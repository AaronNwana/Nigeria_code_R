"5","Aaron_2","NO","Viruses","African swine fever (ASF) is a high-consequence transboundary hemorrhagic fever of swine. It continues to spread across the globe causing socio-economic issues and threatening food security and biodiversity. In 2020, Nigeria reported a major ASF outbreak, killing close to half a million pigs. Based on the partial sequences of the genes B646L (p72) and E183L (p54), the virus responsible for the outbreak was identified as an African swine fever virus (ASFV) p72 genotype II. Here, we report further characterization of ASFV RV502, one of the isolates obtained during the outbreak. The whole genome sequence of this virus revealed a deletion of 6535 bp between the nucleotide positions 11,760-18,295 of the genome, and an apparent reverse complement duplication of the 5' end of the genome at the 3' end. Phylogenetically, ASFV RV502 clustered together with ASFV MAL/19/Karonga and ASFV Tanzania/Rukwa/2017/1 suggesting that the virus responsible for the 2020 outbreak in Nigeria has a South-eastern African origin.","Characterization of a Novel African Swine Fever Virus p72 Genotype II from Nigeria.","15",NA,"Ambagala A and Goonewardene K and Lamboo L and Goolia M and Erdelyan C and Fisher M and Handel K and Lung O and Blome S and King J and Forth JH and Calvelage S and Spinard E and Gladue DP and Masembe C and Adedeji AJ and Olubade T and Maurice NA and Ularamu HG and Luka PD"

EHV-1 primarily causes respiratory disease but viral spread to distant organs enables the development of more severe sequelae; abortion and neurologic disease. The virus can also undergo latency during which viral genes are minimally expressed, and reactivate to produce lytic infection at any time. Recently, there has been a trend of increasing numbers of outbreaks of a devastating form of EHV-1, equine herpesviral myeloencephalopathy. This review presents detailed information on EHV-1, from the discovery of the virus to latest developments on treatment and control of the diseases it causes. We also provide updates on recent EHV-1 research with particular emphasis on viral biology which enables pathogenesis in the natural host. The information presented herein will be useful in understanding EHV-1 and formulating policies that would help limit the spread of EHV-1 within horse populations.","EHV-1: A Constant Threat to the Horse Industry.","10","2668","Oladunni FS and Horohov DW and Chambers TM"

METHODS: Based on a combination of genetic sequence data and H5N1 outbreak information from 2005 to 2011, we use an interdisciplinary approach to improve our understanding of the transmission pattern of this particular clade 2.2, and present cartography of global spatiotemporal transmission footprints with genetic characteristics. RESULTS: Four major viral transmission routes were derived with three sources- Russia, Mongolia, and the Middle East (Kuwait and Saudi Arabia)-in the three consecutive years 2005, 2006 and 2007. With spatiotemporal transmission along each route, genetic distances to isolate A/goose/Guangdong/1996 are becoming significantly larger, leading to a more challenging situation in certain regions like Korea, India, France, Germany, Nigeria and Sudan. Europe and India have had at least two incursions along multiple routes, causing a mixed virus situation. In addition, spatiotemporal distribution along the routes showed that 2007/2008 was a temporal separation point for the infection of different host species; specifically, wild birds were the main host in 2005-2007/2008 and poultry was responsible for the genetic mutation in 2009-2011. ""Global-to-local"" and ""high-to-low latitude"" transmission footprints have been observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that both wild birds and poultry play important roles in the transmission of the H5N1 virus clade, but with different spatial, temporal, and genetic dominance. These characteristics necessitate that special attention be paid to countries along the transmission routes.","Global spatiotemporal and genetic footprint of the H5N1 avian influenza virus.","13","14","Li R and Jiang Z and Xu B"

Malaria vectors biting rhythm, Plasmodium falciparum infection and insecticide resistance genes in malaria vectors were also determined. RESULTS: Overall, 3848 females of Anopheles gambiae s. l were collected and 280 pregnant women responded to the survey. Almost all Anopheles gambiae s. l. tested were Anopheles coluzzi Coetzee and Wilkerson 2013 (Diptera: Culicidae). The CSP index in malaria vector was 1.85% and the allelic frequency of kdr gene was 74.4%. Around 90% of bites and Plasmodium falciparum Welch, 1897 (Haemosporida: Plasmodiidae) transmission occurred between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., which coincides with the period when more than 80% of pregnant women were under bednet. Despite a slight early evening and early morning biting activity of malaria vectors in the study area, the good use of nets might remain a useful protection tool against mosquito biting and malaria transmission.","Human biting rhythm of Anopheles gambiae Giles, 1902 (Diptera: Culicidae) and sleeping behaviour of pregnant women in a lagoon area in Southern Benin.","14","200","Djènontin A and Bouraima A and Soares C and Egbinola S and Cottrell G"
"42","Aaron_2","NO","BMC microbiology","INTRODUCTION: Probiotic lactobacilli are generally recognized as safe (GRAS) and are being used in several food and pharma formulations. However, growing concern of antibiotic resistance in bacterial strains of food origin and its possible transmission via functional foods is increasingly being emphasized. OBJECTIVES: This study screened potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains for their phenotypic and genotypic antibiotic resistance profiles. METHODS: Susceptibility to different antibiotics was assayed by the Kirby Bauer standard disc diffusion protocol. Both conventional and SYBR-RTq-PCR were used for detection of resistance coding genes. RESULTS: A variable susceptibility pattern was documented against different antibiotic classes. LAB strains irrespective of origin displayed marked phenotypic resistance against cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, quinolones, glycopeptides; and methicillin among beta-lactams with few exceptions. In contrast, high sensitivity was recorded against macrolides, sulphonamides and carbapenems sub-group of beta-lactams with some variations. parC, associated with ciprofloxacin resistance was detected in 76.5% of the strains. Other prevalent resistant determinants observed were aac(6?)Ii (42.1%), ermB, ermC (29.4%), and tetM (20.5%). Six (?17.6%) of the isolates were free from genetic resistance determinants screened in this study. CONCLUSION: Study revealed presence of antibiotic resistance determinants among lactobacilli from both fermented foods and human sources.","Antibiotic resistance in potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria of fermented foods and human origin from Nigeria.","23","142","Duche RT and Singh A and Wandhare AG and Sangwan V and Sihag MK and Nwagu TNT and Panwar H and Ezeogu LI"

Several antiretroviral drugs for HIV exhibit anti-HBV effect; however, the selection of HBV drug resistance mutations (DRMs) in individuals under HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been reported but rarely in Nigeria. In this study the HBV/HDV prevalence and HBV DRMs in HIV-positive individuals in Southwestern Nigeria were assessed. METHODS: Plasma samples collected from 310 HIV-positive individuals including 295 ART-experienced and 15 ART-naïve persons attending the HIV clinic in three south-western states of Nigeria between June 2017 and August 2017 were analysed by ELISA for HBsAg and anti-HDV. The presence of HDV RNA and HBV DNA was analysed by (RT)-PCR followed by sequencing and phylogenetic analyses for genotyping. The HBV reverse transcription (RT) region was amplified and sequenced for the analysis of drug resistance mutations. RESULTS: Overall, 16.1% (n = 50/310) of the HIV-positive individuals were positive for HBsAg, most of which were ART-experienced (94.0%; n = 47/50). From the 50 HBsAg-positive samples, 72.0% (n = 36/50) were positive for HBV DNA and 16.0% (n = 8/50) had detectable HDV RNA while 5.6% (n = 2/36) of the HBV-DNA positive samples had anti-HDV total antibodies. Sequences were available for 31/36 of the HBV DNA-positive and 3/8 HDV RNA-positive samples. HBV DNA-positive samples were characterised as HBV genotype E infections exclusively, while HDV genotype 1 was detected in the HDV RNA-positive samples. HBV DRMs V173L, L180M, S202I and M204V/I, which are associated with lamivudine resistance, were detected in 32.2% (n = 10/31) of the HBV DNA-positive samples. Most of these mutations (90.0%; n = 9/10) were present in the ART-experienced cohort. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that HBV/HDV coinfections are common in HIV-positive individuals under ART in Nigeria. Furthermore, a high proportion of HBV DRMs which potentially compromise future treatment options were detected, underscoring the need for HBV screening prior to starting ART. Further studies should be performed to monitor a possible increase in the spread of HDV among populations at risk of HIV and HBV infections.","Prevalence and characteristics of hepatitis B and D virus infections among HIV-positive individuals in Southwestern Nigeria.","18","20","Opaleye OO and Akanbi OA and Osundare FA and Wang B and Adesina O and Oluremi AS and Sunday ST and Akindele AA and Klink P and Bock CT"

(TA)7 promoter polymorphism in the gene encoding the bilirubin conjugating enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) potentiates hyperbilirubinemia in G-6-PD deficient neonates. We studied (TA)n allele frequency to determine, at least in part, its contribution to the frequency and severity of hyperbilirubinemia. DNA was extracted from umbilical cord blood of sequentially born Nigerian neonates and the (TA)n UGT1A1 promoter sequence determined. The (TA)n allele distribution was compared with reported adults of varying African ancestry and Sephardic Jewish neonates. Among 88 Nigerian neonates, (TA)6 and (TA)7 alleles were almost equally distributed (0.46 and 0.43, respectively). Some individuals with (TA)5 and (TA)8 sequences were encountered. Allele distribution was similar to that of the African ancestry population but differed from the Sephardic Jewish newborns, in whom the (TA)6/(TA)7 distribution was 0.65/0.35. Whereas 45% of Nigerian alleles and 50% of African ancestry alleles, respectively, included a (TA)7 or (TA)8 sequence, only 35% of Jewish alleles were (TA)7 (p < 0.001), and no (TA)8 alleles were encountered.

A high proportion (12/30, 40%) of subjects tested positive for both HBsAg and anti-HBs markers.

The current PPR eradication effort relies mainly on the implementation of massive vaccination campaigns. One of the most widely used PPR vaccines is the Nigeria 75/1 strain obtained after attenuation by 75 serial passages of the wild type isolate in cell cultures. Here we use high throughput deep sequencing of the historical passages that led to the Nigeria 75/1 attenuated strain to understand the evolution of PPRV attenuation and to assess the risk of reversal in different cell types. Comparison of the consensus sequences of the wild type and vaccine strains showed that only 18 fixed mutations separate the two strains. At the earliest attenuation passage at our disposal (passage 47), 12 out of the 18 mutations were already present at a frequency of 100%. Low-frequency variants were identified along the genome in all passages. Sequencing of passages after the vaccine strain showed evidence of genetic drift during cell passages, especially in cells expressing the SLAM receptor targeted by PPRV. However, 15 out of the 18 mutations related to attenuation remained fixed in the population. In vitro experiments suggest that one mutation in the leader region of the PPRV genome affects virus replication. Our results suggest that only a few mutations can have a serious impact on the pathogenicity of PPRV. Risk of reversion to virulence of the attenuated PPRV strain Nigeria 75/1 during serial passages in cell cultures seems low but limiting the number of passages during vaccine production is recommended.","Evolution of Attenuation and Risk of Reversal in Peste des Petits Ruminants Vaccine Strain Nigeria 75/1.","11",NA,"Eloiflin RJ and Boyer M and Kwiatek O and Guendouz S and Loire E and Servan de Almeida R and Libeau G and Bataille A"

While varying prevalence rates have been reported in pigs worldwide, there are currently no published reports on the genotypes of Giardia infecting pigs in any African country. The present study is on the prevalence and genotypes of G. duodenalis in 209 pigs raised on four farms in Ogun State Nigeria. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit, Giardia duodenalis coproantigens were detected on all farms and in 25.4% (53/209) of pigs sampled. However, there was no significant influence (p > 0.05) of age, sex and stool consistencies of the pigs on the distribution of the infection. Genotyping of Giardia duodenalis in all ELISA-positive samples, achieved by the amplification of the small subunit ribosomal RNA (ssu rRNA), glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh), triosephosphate isomerase (tpi) and beta giardin (bg) genes, identified 14 and 37 assemblage B and E isolates respectively while mixed infection by both assemblages was recorded in two isolates. Novel nucleotide substitutions were identified in four assemblage B isolates at the ssu rRNA locus. Genetic diversity was observed among the assemblage B isolates after multiple alignment analyses of the gdh, tpi and bg sequences whereby sub-assemblages BII (n = 2), BIII (n = 9) and BIV (n = 3) were identified.

Evidence of links between the mosquito microbiota and insecticide resistance is emerging, with significant enrichment of insecticide degrading bacteria and enzymes in resistant populations. Using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, we characterized and compared the microbiota of Anopheles coluzzii in relation to their deltamethrin resistance and exposure profiles. Comparisons between 2- and 3-day-old deltamethrin-resistant and -susceptible mosquitoes demonstrated significant differences in microbiota diversity. Ochrobactrum, Lysinibacillus, and Stenotrophomonas genera, each of which comprised insecticide-degrading species, were significantly enriched in resistant mosquitoes. Susceptible mosquitoes had a significant reduction in alpha diversity compared to resistant individuals, with Asaia and Serratia dominating microbial profiles. There was no significant difference in deltamethrin-exposed and -unexposed 5- to 6-day-old individuals, suggesting that insecticide exposure had minimal impact on microbial composition. Serratia and Asaia were also dominant in 5- to 6-day-old mosquitoes, which had reduced microbial diversity compared to 2- to 3-day-old mosquitoes. Our findings revealed significant alterations of Anopheles coluzzii microbiota associated with deltamethrin resistance, highlighting the potential for identification of novel microbial markers for insecticide resistance surveillance. qPCR detection of Serratia and Asaia was consistent with 16S rRNA sequencing, suggesting that population-level field screening of bacterial microbiota may be feasibly integrated into wider resistance monitoring, if reliable and reproducible markers associated with phenotype can be identified. IMPORTANCE Control of insecticide-resistant vector populations remains a significant challenge to global malaria control and while substantial progress has been made elucidating key target site mutations, overexpressed detoxification enzymes and alternate gene families, the contribution of the mosquito microbiota to phenotypic insecticide resistance has been largely overlooked. We focused on determining the effects of deltamethrin resistance intensity on Anopheles coluzzii microbiota and identifying any microbial taxa associated with phenotype.

Aim is to generate empirical updated evidence of leptospiral infection and delineate serovars involved. METHODS: Study determined the sero-prevalence and infection rate in 342 dogs using sero-assays, culture isolation and novel qPCR. In-house designed primers targeting conserved regions were used to amplify genes in quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) for leptospiral detection to serogroups. Molecular analysis of the leptospiral 16S rRNA and LipL32 genes were used for identification of pathogenic Leptospira species. Primers targeting the O-antigen (rfb) region of the Leptospira lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were used for differentiating serovars based on comparative melting temperature (T(m)) analysis against reference serogroups. RESULTS: Overall serological and bacteriological prevalence of 56 (16.4%) and 40 (11.7%) respectively was recorded. Vaccination, ages and season(s) were the strongest determinants of infection. Unvaccinated animals, stray dogs and symptomatic dogs presented statistically significant (P < 0.05) higher risk of infection: OR 25.531 (6.108, 106.712; 95% CI).

"166","Aaron_2","YES","Malaria journal","BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest causative agent of malaria, has high prevalence in Nigeria. Drug resistance causing failure of previously effective drugs has compromised anti-malarial treatment. On this basis, there is need for a proactive surveillance for resistance markers to the currently recommended artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), for early detection of resistance before it become widespread. METHODS: This study assessed anti-malarial resistance genes polymorphism in patients with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in Lagos, Nigeria. Sanger and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) methods were used to screen for mutations in thirty-seven malaria positive blood samples targeting the P. falciparum chloroquine-resistance transporter (Pfcrt), P. falciparum multidrug-resistance 1 (Pfmdr1), and P. falciparum kelch 13 (Pfk13) genes, which have been previously associated with anti-malarial resistance. RESULTS: Expectedly, the NGS method was more proficient, detecting six Pfmdr1, seven Pfcrt and three Pfk13 mutations in the studied clinical isolates from Nigeria, a malaria endemic area. These mutations included rare Pfmdr1 mutations, N504K, N649D, F938Y and S967N, which were previously unreported. In addition, there was moderate prevalence of the K76T mutation (34.6%) associated with chloroquine and amodiaquine resistance, and high prevalence of the N86 wild type allele (92.3%) associated with lumefantrine resistance. CONCLUSION: Widespread circulation of mutations associated with resistance to current anti-malarial drugs could potentially limit effective malaria therapy in endemic populations.","Rare mutations in Pfmdr1 gene of Plasmodium falciparum detected in clinical isolates from patients treated with anti-malarial drug in Nigeria.","18","319","Idowu AO and Oyibo WA and Bhattacharyya S and Khubbar M and Mendie UE and Bumah VV and Black C and Igietseme J and Azenabor AA"

The frequency of alpha thalassaemia is equally high among Nigerians but there is little information on beta thalassaemia in this population. A recent study however suggest a high prevalence of beta thalassaemia in the same population, hence the need for this study. METHODS: Haemoglobin A(2) and HbF were determined in healthy adults who have haemoglobin A genotype by elution after electrophoresis and alkaline denaturation methods respectively. RESULTS: The mean HbA(2) among the subjects was 3.3% (range 2.0-5.6%) while the mean HbF was 2.6% (range 0.4-8.8%). Twenty-six percent of the subjects had HbA(2) values higher than 3.9% while 86% had HbF values greater than 1%, twenty-four percent had elevated HbA(2) and HbF. The mean HbA(2) value was 2.7% among those with HbF <1%, 3.6% among those with HbF 1-3% and 3.1% among those with HbF >3%. CONCLUSION: These findings confirm that the frequency of beta thalassaemia in western Nigeria is higher than previously thought and that many of the individuals studied may be silent carriers of the beta thalassaemia trait. Its presence may also have been masked by the high prevalence of alpha thalassaemia in the same environment.

In humans, most cases of campylobacteriosis are caused by Campylobacter jejuni. Poultry is the main reservoir of Campylobacter for humans, because Campylobacter is part of the normal flora of the digestive tract of poultry. Antimicrobial resistance to several antibiotics in Campylobacter isolated from humans and food animals has increased rapidly.

Campylobacter jejuni was identified using conventional and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods. Phenotypic detection of beta-lactam resistance was performed using an antimicrobial susceptibility test with antibiotic disks of aztreonam, ampicillin, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Genotypic detection by PCR was performed using the bla(OXA-61) gene, which encodes beta-lactamase. RESULTS: Campylobacter jejuni was identified in 23% of the samples. Phenotypically, 100% (23/23) and 73.9% (17/23) C. jejuni isolates had high resistance to aztreonam and ampicillin, respectively, but all isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Genotypically, all isolates carried bla(OXA-61), indicated by the presence of a 372-bp PCR product. CONCLUSION: Campylobacter jejuni is highly resistant to beta-lactams and is a serious threat to human health. Resistance to beta-lactams should be monitored because beta-lactamase genes can be transferred between bacteria. Public awareness must also be increased on the importance of using antibiotics rationally in humans and animals.","First report of phenotypic and genotypic (bla(OXA-61)) beta-lactam resistance in Campylobacter jejuni from broilers in Indonesia.","16","2210-2216","Yanestria SM and Effendi MH and Tyasningsih W and Mariyono M and Ugbo EN"
"192","Aaron_2","YES","Infectious diseases of poverty","BACKGROUND: The spleen plays a pivotal role in the rapid clearance of parasitized red blood cells in patients with falciparum malaria after artemisinin treatment. Prolonged parasite clearance can be found in patients who have had a splenectomy, or those with hemoglobin abnormalities and/or reduced immunity, which are all distinguishable from artemisinin resistance. This paper reports on a case of prolonged parasite clearance in a Chinese splenectomized patient with falciparum malaria imported from Nigeria. CASE PRESENTATION: A 35-year-old Chinese male suffered 2 days of febrile illness after returning to Zhumadian city of Henan province from Nigeria on October 1, 2014. The main symptoms were febrile, including the highest axillary temperature of 40 °C, headache, and chills. A peripheral blood smear showed parasitemia (53 913 asexual parasites/μl) of Plasmodium falciparum. The patient had not used any chemoprophylaxis against malaria in Nigeria when he worked there as a construction worker between 2009 and 2014. The patient had three episodes of malaria in Nigeria and had a splenectomy due to a traffic accident 8 years ago from the time he was admitted to hospital. The patient was orally administrated a total of 320 mg/2.56 g dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine for 2 days and intravenously administrated a total of 3 000 mg artesunate for 18 days. The axillary temperature of the patient ranged between 37.0 and 37.7 °C from Day 0 to Day 3, and blood microscopy revealed falciparum malaria parasitemia (26 674 asexual parasites/μl) on Day 3. The patient was afebrile on Day 4, falciparum malaria parasitemia was continuously present and then gradually decreased on the next days, and was negative on Day 21. The patient was cured and left hospital on Day 24 after no plasmodium falciparum was found in the blood on Day 21 to Day 23. No mutation was found in the K13 propeller gene when compared with the PF3D7_1343700 K13 propeller gene reference sequence. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first reported case in China of prolonged parasite clearance in a splenectomized patient with imported falciparum malaria. Artemisinin resistance should be distinguished when prolonged parasite clearance is found in a malaria patient who has had splenectomy.","Prolonged parasite clearance in a Chinese splenectomized patient with falciparum malaria imported from Nigeria.","6","44","Zhang HW and Li SJ and Hu T and Yu YM and Yang CY and Zhou RM and Liu Y and Tang J and Wang JJ and Wang XY and Sun YX and Feng ZC and Xu BL"

Analysis was conducted by genotyping of three single-copy African swine fever (ASF) genes. The E183L and B646L genes that encode structural proteins p54 and p72, respectively, were utilized to delineate genotypes before intragenotypic resolution by characterization of the tetrameric amino acid repeat region within the hypervariable central variable region of the B602L gene. The results showed no variation in the p72 and p54 gene regions sequenced. Phylogeny of p72 sequences revealed that all the Nigerian isolates belonged to genotype I, while that of the p54 recovered the Ia genotype. Analysis of B602L gene revealed the differences in the number of tetrameric repeats. Four new variants (Tet-15, Tet-17a, Tet-17b and Tet-48) were recovered, while a fifth variant (Tet-20) was the most widely distributed in the country displacing Tet-36 reported previously in 2003-2006. The viruses responsible for ASF outbreaks in Nigeria are from very closely related but mutated variants of the virus that have been circulating since 1997. A practical implication of the genetic variability of the Nigerian viral isolates in this study is the need for continuous sampling and analysis of circulating viruses, which will provide epidemiological information on the evolution of ASFV in the field versus new incursion for informed strategic control of the disease in the country.","Genetic Characterization of Circulating African Swine Fever Viruses in Nigeria (2007-2015).","64","1598-1609","Luka PD and Achenbach JE and Mwiine FN and Lamien CE and Shamaki D and Unger H and Erume J"

It is critical to decipher the role of single or co-infected disease scenarios on immune system regulation in such individuals and how such co-infections can either ameliorate or complicate immune response and the consequent disease outcome. First, 10 ml of urine samples, collected between 10:00 am and 2:00 pm, was filtered for diagnosis of schistosomiasis, while egg count, indicative of disease severity, was determined by microscopy. Furthermore, genomic DNA samples extracted from dried blood spots collected on filter paper from one hundred and forty-four Schistosoma haematobium-infected school-children was tested for P. falciparum parasite positivity by an allele-specific nested-PCR analysis of merozoite surface protein (msp)-1 and -2 genes and a real-time PCR assay. In addition, among P. falciparum parasite-positive individuals, we carried out a Taqman SNP genotyping assay to extrapolate the effect of host CD14 (-159 C/T; rs2569190) genetic variants on schistosome egg count. RESULTS: Of the 144 individuals recruited, P. falciparum parasite positivity with msp-1 gene were 34%, 43% and 55% for MAD20, RO33 and K1 alleles respectively. Of the co-infected individuals, CD14 genetic variants ranged from 18.8% vs 21.5%, 33.3% vs 44.4%, 9.7% vs 11.8% for single versus schistosome co-infection for the wild type (CC), heterozygous (CT) and mutant (TT) variants respectively. Though the mean egg count for co-infected individuals with CD14 wild type (33.7 eggs per 10 ml of urine) and heterozygote variants (37.5 eggs per 10 ml of urine) were lower than that of schistosome infection alone (52.48 and 48.08 eggs/10 ml of urine respectively), it lacked statistical significance (p-value 0.12 and 0.29), possibly reflecting the benefit of the CD14 activation in schistosome plus malaria co-infection and not schistosome infection alone. In addition, the lower mean egg count in co-infected individuals reveal the benefit of downstream Th1 immune response mitigated by CD14 innate activation that is absent in schistosome infection alone.","Severity of Schistosoma haematobium co-infection with malaria in school-children is potentially modulated by host CD14 gene variants.","16","199","Oboh-Imafidon MA and Torbit SM and Jacob S and Schroeter MN and Tucker AR and Ojurongbe O and Thomas BN"

A total of 300 PCR confirmed Escherichia coli isolates recovered from different river sources in Osun State, Nigeria were evaluated for their antibiogram profiling by the disc diffusion method and the resistant isolates were further profiled for their genotypic antimicrobial resistance determinants by polymerase chain reaction assays. Among the 20 antimicrobials selected from 10 families, resistance among sulfonamides, β-lactams and tetracyclines were found to be most frequent than phenicols and aminoglycosides with a noticeable increase in the number of multi-drug resistance ranging from three to nine antimicrobials. A total of 19 resistance determinants were assessed with their prevalence and distributions obtained as follows; [sulfonamides sulI (8%), sulII (41%)], [β-lactams; ampC 22%; blaTEM, (21%), and blaZ (18%),], [tetracyclines tetA (24%), tetB (23%), tetC (18%), tetD (78%), tetK (15%), and tetM, (10%)], [phenicols; catI (37%), catII (28%), and cmIA1 (19%)] and [aminoglycosides; aacC2 (8%), aphA1 (80%), aphA2 (80%), aadA (79%) and strA (38%)]. The Pearson chi-square exact test revealed many strong significant associations among ampC, blaTEM, blaZ and tetA genes with some determinants screened. The findings signify high increase in the prevalence of multidrug resistant E. coli isolates and resistance determinants indicating increased public health risks associated with the ingestion of waters from untreated sources. Hence, a necessity for safe water supply, provision of proper sanitation facilities and good surveillance programmes to monitor antimicrobial resistance patterns in water bodies.","Antimicrobial resistance determinants of Escherichia coli isolates recovered from some rivers in Osun State, South-Western Nigeria: Implications for public health.","523","82-94","Titilawo Y and Obi L and Okoh A"

Exposure to foodborne Salmonella directly or indirectly through consumption of ready-to-eat seafood can be an important route of infection to humans. This study was designed to estimate the population cell density, prevalence, virulence gene signatures, and antibiotic resistance of Salmonella serovars from ready-to-eat shrimps. Ready-to-eat (RTE) shrimp samples were obtained from different open markets in Delta and Edo States, Nigeria from November 2016 to October 2017. We employed classical and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approaches. The mean Salmonella species enumerated from the RTE shrimps ranged from -0.301 to 5.434 log(10) cfu/g with 210/1440 (14.58%) of the RTE shrimp samples harbored Salmonella species. After biochemical and PCR approach, the identified isolates were Salmonella Enteritidis 11(24.4%), Salmonella Typhimurium 14 (31.1%) and other Salmonella spp. 20 (44.4%). All Salmonella species recovered were resistant to penicillin and erythromycin with 100% sensitivity to cefotaxime, cephalothin, colistin, and polymyxin B. Findings on the multidrug-resistant (MDR) profile showed that a total of 9/14 (64.3%) of Salmonella Enteritidis were resistant to 5 antibiotics which belongs to 3 different groups of antimicrobials with a multiple antibiotic-resistant (MAR) index of 0.21; while 3/11 (27.3%) of Salmonella Typhimurium were resistant to 11 antibiotics which belongs to 7 different groups of antimicrobials with a MAR index of 0.46. Virulence genes (spiA, sipB, invA, sif A, fljB, and sefA) and resistance genes (class 1 and II integrase, sul2, catB3, flor, tmp, bla (TEM), strB, dfr1, and tetC) were also detected in some of the Salmonella species with variable percentage. This study indicates that ready-to-eat shrimps are probable reservoirs harboring Salmonella strains.

This epidemiological problem has been studied, but its magnitude and impact on a global scale is poorly characterised. A systematic review was done to determine global prevalence and distribution patterns of antimicrobial resistance in effluent wastewater from animal slaughter facilities. Extracted data were stratified into rational groups for secondary analyses and presented as percentages. Culture and sensitivity testing was the predominant method; Escherichia spp., Enterococcus spp., and Staphylococcus aureus were the most targeted isolates. Variable incidences of resistance were detected against all major antimicrobial classes including reserved drugs such as ceftazidime, piperacillin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and chloramphenicol; the median frequency and range in resistant Gram-negative isolates were: 11 (0-100), 62 (0-100), 8 (0-100), 14 (0-93) and 12 (0-62) respectively. Ciprofloxacin was the most tested drug with the highest incidences of resistance in livestock slaughterhouses in Iran (93%), Nigeria (50%) and China (20%), and poultry slaughterhouses in Germany (21-81%) and Spain (56%). Spatial global distribution patterns for antimicrobial resistance were associated with previously reported magnitude of antibiotic use in livestock or poultry farming and, the implicit existence of jurisdictional policies to regulate antibiotic use. These data indicate that anthropogenic activities in farming systems are a major contributor to the cause and dissemination of antimicrobial resistance into the environment via slaughterhouse effluents.","Prevalence and distribution of antimicrobial resistance in effluent wastewater from animal slaughter facilities: A systematic review.","318","120848","Foyle L and Burnett M and Creaser A and Hens R and Keough J and Madin L and Price R and Smith H and Stone S and Kinobe RT"

Data on second-line failure and development of protease inhibitor (PI) resistance in sub-Saharan Africa are scarce. METHODS: HIV-1-infected adults were included if they received >180 days of PI-based second-line ART. We assessed risk factors for having a detectable viral load (VL, ≥400 cps/mL) using Cox models. If VL was ≥1000 cps/mL, genotyping was performed. RESULTS: Of 227 included participants, 14.6%, 15.2% and 11.1% had VLs ≥400 cps/mL at 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively. Risk factors for a detectable VL were as follows: exposure to nonstandard nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based (hazard ratio, 7.10; 95% confidence interval, 3.40-14.83; P < .001) or PI-based (7.59; 3.02-19.07; P = .001) first-line regimen compared with zidovudine/lamivudine/NNRTI, PI resistance at switch (6.69; 2.49-17.98; P < .001), and suboptimal adherence (3.05; 1.71-5.42; P = .025). Among participants with VLs ≥1000 cps/mL, 22 of 32 (69%) harbored drug resistance mutation(s), and 7 of 32 (22%) harbored PI resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Although VL suppression rates were high, PI resistance was detected in 22% of participants with VLs ≥1000 cps/mL. To ensure long-term ART success, intensified support for adherence, VL and drug resistance testing, and third-line drugs will be necessary.","Protease Inhibitor Resistance in the First 3 Years of Second-Line Antiretroviral Therapy for HIV-1 in Sub-Saharan Africa.","214","873-83","Boender TS and Hamers RL and Ondoa P and Wellington M and Chimbetete C and Siwale M and Labib Maksimos EE and Balinda SN and Kityo CM and Adeyemo TA and Akanmu AS and Mandaliya K and Botes ME and Stevens W and Rinke de Wit TF and Sigaloff KC"

The cereus group are usually isolated from the environmental/food samples and have been implicated in debilitating human and animal anthrax-like diseases. This study was designed to investigate the presence of the anthrax virulence genes in different Bacillus spp. isolated from handwashing facilities during COVID-19 pandemic in Lagos, Nigeria. METHODOLOGY: The Bacillus anthracis (OK316847), B. thuringiensis (OK316855), B. amyloliquefaciens (OK316857), B. cereus (OK316858) and B. thuringiensis (OK316859) previously isolated from rinsates and bowl water in two local government areas (LGAs) of Lagos state were further investigated by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the pag and cap genes using specific primers. RESULTS: Bacillus anthracis and B. cereus co-harboured the two 578 bp cap and 364 bp pag genes while B. thuringiensis only harboured the cap gene. Similarly, the non-cereus B. amyloliquefaciens was found to habour the pag gene. CONCLUSIONS: The two anthrax toxin genes were amplified in the Bacillus spp isolated from rinsates and bowl water used in hand washing in the two study LGAs. Given that these virulence genes have a global consequence and are a potential threat to life, this study calls for an extensive surveillance, and reassessment of gene regulators and plasmid distribution among these strains in our environment.","Anthrax toxins-producing Bacillus spp. isolated from handwashing stations during COVID-19 pandemic in Lagos, Nigeria.","17","1076-1080","Bamidele TA and Odumosu BT and Adenola PT and Ameh J and Kareem OK and Osoba B and Ezechi OC and Salako BL"
