This study evaluated WBS as a pandemic preparedness tool, by selectively isolating and culturing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) with CHROMagar MRSA. Some 24-h composite wastewater samples (n = 80) were collected from ten treatment plants across Finland between February 2021 and January 2022. MRSA prevalence in wastewater samples was 27.5% (n = 22/80), showing seasonal and temporal variations. Phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) with microdilution showed that over 80% of isolates were drug-resistant to clindamycin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, tetracycline, fusidic acid, and erythromycin. Four isolates (18.2%) were vancomycin-resistant. WGS revealed that 31.8% (n = 7) of the isolates belonged to the ST8-t008 and ST6-t304 spa types, respectively. In addition, two spa types (t011 and t034) belong to the CC398 complex. The mecA gene was found in all isolates (n = 22) and three tetracycline resistance determinants (tet38, tetK, and tetM) were detected with tet38 being the most abundant (81.8%, n = 18/22). Three isolates harboured the plasmid-mediated sat4 gene that confers resistance to Streptothricin. In addition, resistance determinants to macrolide antibiotics (mph (C)/msr (A) and fosfomycin (fosB) were detected in the seven isolates that belonged to spa type t008. All isolates except one harboured the SCCmec_type_IVa(2B). Six ST8 isolates harboured the LukS/F-PV genes encoding the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) and were also positive for the Arginine Catabolic Mobile Element (ACME), suggesting they belong to the USA300 clone. The Inc18 plasmid was the most abundant as it was detected in 72.7% (n = 16/22) of the isolates. Other plasmid replicons detected were the rep_trans and repA_N which were detected in 45.4% (n = 10/22) and 40.9% (n = 9/22) of the isolates respectively. Ten isolates harboured at least three plasmid replicons and no plasmid replicons were detected in four isolates (ST6/t304). The cgMLST revealed that some isolates aggregated into two genomically indistinguishable clusters: ST6/t304 belonging to cluster type CT12405 (≤20 allelic differences) and ST8/t008 belonging to cluster type CT1925 (<8 allelic differences). Overall, we found a high genotypic concordance with the national clinical bacterial resistance data. Our study demonstrates the sensitivity of culture-based wastewater surveillance for MRSA using clinical media following pre-enrichment, reliably predicting pathogen occurrence at the population level.","Characterization of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus Aureus in municipal wastewater in Finland.","19","100881","Al-Mustapha AI and Tiwari A and Johansson V and Heljanko V and Kirsi-Maarit L and Lipponen A and Oikarinen S and Pitkänen T and Heikinheimo A"
"11","Aaron_3","NO","Heliyon","The emergence of bacteria that is resistant to several drugs of clinical importance poses a threat to successful treatment, a phenomenon known as multidrug resistance that affects diverse classes of antibiotics. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp. and Staphylococcus aureus in chicken egg, meat and faeces from four districts of Bangladesh. A total of 120 chicken samples were collected from different poultry farms. Conventional culture and molecular detection methods were used for identification of bacterial isolates from the collected samples followed by antibiotic susceptibility test through the disc diffusion method, finally antibiotic resistant genes were detected by PCR. E. coli, Salmonella spp. and Staphylococcus aureus were detected in meat, egg and faecal samples. Antimicrobial susceptibility results revealed isolates from faeces were 100 % resistant to amoxicillin, while all S. aureus and Salmonella sp. from faeces were resistant to doxycycline, tetracycline and erythromycin. Salmonella spp. isolates from eggs indicated 100 % resistance to erythromycin, amoxycillin, while E. coli were 100 % resistant to erythromycin. E. coli and S. aureus from meat were 100 % resistant to amoxicillin and erythromycin. However, Salmonella spp. from eggs were 100 % susceptible to doxycycline, gentamicin, levofloxacin and tetracycline. The mecA and aac(3)-IV genes were only found in S. aureus and E. coli, respectively. The Sul1, tetB, and aadA1 were highest in Salmonella spp. and S. aureus, while the sul1, tetA and bla (SHV) were higher in E. coli. Isolates from all samples were multidrug resistant. These findings indicate a high risk of transmission of resistance genes from microbial contamination to food of animal origin. The study emphasizes the need for effective biosecurity measures, responsible antibiotic use, and strict regulations in poultry production to prevent the spread of antibiotic resistance.","Assessment of the presence of multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli, Salmonella and Staphylococcus in chicken meat, eggs and faeces in Mymensingh division of Bangladesh.","10","e36690","Rafiq K and Sani AA and Hossain MT and Hossain MT and Hadiuzzaman M and Bhuiyan MAS"

In order to predict drug targets in silico, a useful model for the metabolism is needed. However, automatically reconstructed network models typically cover more non-confirmed enzymes than confirmed enzymes of known gene products. Furthermore, it needs to be considered that the parasite takes advantage of the metabolism of the host. We compared several reconstructed network models and aimed to find the best suitable reconstruction for detecting drug targets in silico. We computationally reconstructed the metabolism based on automatically inferred enzymes and compared this with a reconstructed model that was based only on enzymes whose coding genes are known. Additionally, we tested if integrating enzymes of the host cell is beneficial for such an analysis. We employed several well established criteria for defining essential enzymes including chokepoints, betweenness centrality (or load-points), connectivity and the diameter of the networks. Comparing the modeling results with a comprehensive list of known drug targets for P. falciparum, showed that we had the best discovery success with a network model consisting only of enzymes from the parasite alone which coding genes were known.","Comparing metabolic network models based on genomic and automatically inferred enzyme information from Plasmodium and its human host to define drug targets in silico.","11","201-8","Fatumo S and Plaimas K and Adebiyi E and König R"

Since S. aureus carriage is a risk factor for postoperative wound infection, patients who had been hospitalized in surgical wards in a Nigerian University Teaching Hospital were screened for S. aureus carriage. All S. aureus isolates were genotyped (spa, agr) and assigned to multilocus sequence types (MLST). Species affiliation, methicillin-resistance, and the possession of pyrogenic toxin superantigens (PTSAg), exfoliative toxins (ETs) and Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL) were analyzed. Of 192 patients screened, the S. aureus carrier rate was 31.8 % (n = 61). Of these isolates, 7 (11.5%) were methicillin-resistant (MRSA). The isolates comprised 24 spa types. The most frequent spa types were t064, t084, t311, and t1931, while the most prevalent MLST clonal complexes were CC5 and CC15. The most frequent PTSAg genes detected were seg/sei (41.0%) followed by seb (29.5%), sea (19.7%), seh (14.7%) and sec (11.5). The difference between the possession of classical and newly described PTSAg genes was not significant (63.9% versus 59.0% respectively; P = 0.602). PVL encoding genes were found in 39.3% isolates. All MRSA isolates were PVL negative, SCCmec types I and VI in MLST CC 5 and CC 30, respectively. Typing of the accessory gene regulator (agr) showed the following distribution: agr group 1 (n = 20), group II (n = 17), group III (n = 14) and group IV (n = 10). Compared to European data, enterotoxin gene seb and PVL-encoding genes were more prevalent in Nigerian methicillin-susceptible S. aureus isolates, which may therefore act as potential reservoir for PVL and PTSAg genes.","Characterization of colonizing Staphylococcus aureus isolated from surgical wards' patients in a Nigerian university hospital.","8","e68721","Kolawole DO and Adeyanju A and Schaumburg F and Akinyoola AL and Lawal OO and Amusa YB and Köck R and Becker K"

However, little is known about the frequency or reporting of SFs in Africans, who are underrepresented in large-scale population genomic studies. The availability of data from the first whole-genome sequencing for orofacial clefts in an African population motivated this investigation. METHODS: In total, 130 case-parent trios were analyzed for SFs within the ACMG SFv.3.0 list genes. Additionally, we filtered for four more genes (HBB, HSD32B, G6PD and ACADM). RESULTS: We identified 246 unique variants in 55 genes; five variants in four genes were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP). The P/LP variants were seen in 2.3% (9/390) of the subjects, a frequency higher than ~1% reported for diverse ethnicities. On the ACMG list, pathogenic variants were observed in PRKAG (p. Glu183Lys). Variants in the PALB2 (p. Glu159Ter), RYR1 (p. Arg2163Leu) and LDLR (p. Asn564Ser) genes were predicted to be LP. CONCLUSION: This study provides information on the frequency and pathogenicity of SFs in an African cohort. Early risk detection will help reduce disease burden and contribute to efforts to increase knowledge of the distribution and impact of actionable genomic variants in diverse populations.","Clinically actionable secondary findings in 130 triads from sub-Saharan African families with non-syndromic orofacial clefts.","11","e2237","Oladayo A and Gowans LJJ and Awotoye W and Alade A and Busch T and Naicker T and Eshete MA and Adeyemo WL and Hetmanski JB and Zeng E and Adamson O and Adeleke C and Li M and Sule V and Kayali S and Olotu J and Mossey PA and Obiri-Yeboah S and Buxo CJ and Beaty T and Taub M and Donkor P and Marazita ML and Odukoya O and Adeyemo AA and Murray JC and Prince A and Butali A"

Malaria is caused by infection with a protozoan parasite of the genus Plasmodium and LF by the parasitic worm Wuchereria bancrofti. Updating our knowledge of the Anopheles species is vital in planning and implementing evidence based vector control programs. To present a comprehensive report on the spatial distribution and composition of these vectors, all published data available were collated into a database. Details recorded for each source were the locality, latitude/longitude, time/period of study, species, abundance, sampling/collection methods, morphological and molecular species identification methods, insecticide resistance status, including evidence of the kdr allele, and P. falciparum sporozoite rate and W. bancrofti microfilaria prevalence. This collation resulted in a total of 110 publications, encompassing 484,747 Anopheles mosquitoes in 632 spatially unique descriptions at 142 georeferenced locations being identified across Nigeria from 1900 to 2010. Overall, the highest number of vector species reported included An. gambiae complex (65.2%), An. funestus complex (17.3%), An. gambiae s.s. (6.5%). An. arabiensis (5.0%) and An. funestus s.s. (2.5%), with the molecular forms An. gambiae M and S identified at 120 locations. A variety of sampling/collection and species identification methods were used with an increase in molecular techniques in recent decades. Insecticide resistance to pyrethroids and organochlorines was found in the main Anopheles species across 45 locations. Presence of P. falciparum and W. bancrofti varied between species with the highest sporozoite rates found in An. gambiae s.s, An. funestus s.s. and An. moucheti, and the highest microfilaria prevalence in An. gambiae s.l., An. arabiensis, and An. gambiae s.s.

This study aimed to determine the dynamics of insecticide susceptibility levels and the frequency of knock-down resistance (kdr) mutations (L1014F) in wild Anopheles coluzzii Coetzee & Wilkerson sp. n. and Anopheles gambiae Giles from the Ojoo and Bodija areas of Ibadan, in southwest Nigeria. Insecticide susceptibility to pyrethroids, organophosphates, carbamates and organochlorines was assessed using World Health Organization (WHO) bioassays. A subset of the mosquitoes exposed to pyrethroids and DDT was used for species and molecular form identification; kdr genotyping was determined using the TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction assay. The mosquitoes were resistant to pyrethroids and DDT but completely susceptible to organophosphates and carbamates. Bodija samples (n = 186) consisted of An. gambiae (91.4%) and An. coluzzii (8.1%) and included one An. coluzzii/An. gambiae hybrid specimen. All mosquitoes screened in Ojoo (n = 26) were An. gambiae. The 1014F kdr mutation was detected at frequencies of 24.5 and 5.8% in Bodija and Ojoo, respectively. No correlation was observed between kdr genotypes and resistance phenotypes. The results indicate that metabolic resistance probably plays an important role in the development of resistance and highlight the need to implement insecticide resistance management strategies.","Insecticide susceptibility of Anopheles coluzzii and Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes in Ibadan, Southwest Nigeria.","29","44-50","Okorie PN and Ademowo OG and Irving H and Kelly-Hope LA and Wondji CS"

This study evaluated the current prevalence of Pfcrt and Pfmdr1 alleles in Plasmodium falciparum isolates, 11 years after CQ withdrawal in Southeast Nigeria. METHODS: Filter-paper blood samples were collected from 725 non-febrile individuals, comprising 250 children (≤ 12 years), 250 pregnant women and 225 other adults, between October 2014 and February 2015 in Nnewi town, Southeast Nigeria. Nested PCR followed by direct sequencing was employed for the genotyping of Pfcrt and Pfmdr1 genes. RESULTS: A total of 103 parasites-positive samples were recovered, comprising of 48 (19.20%) among children, 20 (20.00%) among pregnant women and 35 (15.50%) among other adults cohort. The frequency of the mutant genotype of Pfcrt 76T, 75E and 74I was 94.50% each. Parasite isolates from children had a frequency of 100% for mutant alleles in all Pfcrt codons while isolates from pregnant women and other adults had a frequency of 91% each in all codons. Haplotype distribution of pfcrt gene were 5.45, 0.00 and 76.37% for CVMNK, SVMNT and CVIET, respectively. For Pfmdr1 gene, the frequency of 86Y, 184F and 1246Y mutant alleles were 8.54, 29.27 and 3.66%, respectively. Amongst the Pfmdr1 haplotypes analysed, NFD had the highest frequency of 24.4%, followed by YFD at 6.10%. NYF and NYY occurred the least (1.20%). CONCLUSION: The high level of Pfcrt mutations is suggestive of a sustained CQ pressure on P. falciparum isolates in the study area, despite the change of first line treatment from CQ to artemisinin combination therapy for 11 years. A new strategy to ensure the complete withdrawal of CQ from the country is recommended.","Analysis of Plasmodium falciparum Pfcrt and Pfmdr1 genes in parasite isolates from asymptomatic individuals in Southeast Nigeria 11 years after withdrawal of chloroquine.","18","343","Ikegbunam MN and Nkonganyi CN and Thomas BN and Esimone CO and Velavan TP and Ojurongbe O"

Mutations in the surface and polymerase genes of HBV have been associated with occult infection, drug resistance, vaccine escape, as well as HCC.Hypothesis/Gap Statement. There is limited data on the occurrence and patterns of mutations associated with occult infection, drug resistance, vaccine escape and HCC for HBV/E.Aim. This study characterized amino acid (aa) substitutions in the major hydrophilic (MHR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) regions of the surface and polymerase genes respectively of HBV sequences from a group of Nigerians with genotype E infection. The CpG islands of the PreC/C and PreS/S regions of these sequences were also described.Methodology. HBV surface and polymerase genes were detected using PCR techniques. Occurrence of new and previously described mutations in these genes were analysed using phylogenetic techniques.Results. Overall 13 HBV isolates were each sequenced for polymerase and surface genes mutations. Thirteen and nine PreS/S and PreC/C HBV genes respectively were analysed for CpG islands. Mutations in the MHR and a-determinants region of the S protein were discovered in eleven and nine of the 13 tested isolates respectively. These mutations were concomitant with aa changes in the RT functional domains of the isolates. Mutations associated with vaccine escape, occult infection and poor HCC prognosis were identified in HBV/E isolated in this study. Furthermore, all the isolates had at least one putative nucleotide analogue resistance mutations. Drug resistance mutations had the highest association with CpG islands.Conclusion. The results of this study contribute to further understanding of HBV variability in Nigeria and the West African region.

No genome-wide association study (GWAS) for body mass index (BMI) has been conducted in continental Africans. METHODS: We performed a GWAS for BMI in 1,570 West Africans (WA). Replication was conducted in independent samples of WA (n = 1,411) and African Americans (AA) (n = 9,020). RESULTS: We identified a novel genome-wide significant African-specific locus for BMI (SEMA4D, rs80068415; minor allele frequency = 0.008, P = 2.10 × 10(-8) ). This finding was replicated in independent samples of WA (P = 0.013) and AA (P = 0.017). Individuals with obesity had higher serum SEMA4D levels compared to those without obesity (P < 0.0001), and elevated levels of serum SEMA4D were associated with increased obesity risk (OR = 4.2, P < 1 × 10(-4) ). The prevalence of obesity was higher in individuals with the CT versus TT genotypes (55.6% vs. 22.9%). CONCLUSIONS: A novel variant in SEMA4D was significantly associated with BMI. Carriers of the C allele were 4.6 BMI units heavier than carriers of the T allele (P = 0.0007).

However, human epidemics during RVF outbreaks in eastern Africa have involved 478 deaths in 1998, 1107 reported cases with 350 deaths from 2006 to 2007 and 1174 cases with 241 deaths in 2008. We review the history of RVF outbreaks in eastern Africa to identify the epidemiological factors that could have influenced its increasing severity in humans. Diverse ecological factors influence outbreak frequency, whereas virus evolution has a greater impact on its virulence in hosts. Several factors could have influenced the lack of information on RVF in humans during earlier outbreaks, but the explosive nature of human RVF epidemics in recent years mirrors the evolutionary trend of the virus. Comparisons between isolates from different outbreaks have revealed an accumulation of genetic mutations and genomic reassortments that have diversified RVF virus genomes over several decades. The threat to humans posed by the diversified RVF virus strains increases the potential public health and socioeconomic impacts of future outbreaks. Understanding the shifting RVF epidemiology as determined by its evolution is key to developing new strategies for outbreak mitigation and prevention of future human RVF casualties.","Has Rift Valley fever virus evolved with increasing severity in human populations in East Africa?","5","e58","Baba M and Masiga DK and Sang R and Villinger J"

METHODS: SNPs with MAF>0.01 and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P>0.01) were identified as qualified SNPs by Haploview. The MAFs of qualified SNPs were analyzed and the relative range ratios of the MAFs were developed to measure the differences in MAFs for common qualified SNPs with mutual minor allele among the samples. Haplotype blocks and haplotype frequencies for common qualified SNPs in four samples were analyzed and compared among the samples. Transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) was carried out to identify the association between rs7599810 and NSCL/P using 183 NSCL/P case-parent trios. RESULTS: Among the 24 SNPs released by HapMap project, the number of monotonic SNPs was 9 in Han Chinese in Beijing, China (CHB) and Japanese in Tokyo, Japan (JPT) samples, 8 in Utah residents with Northern and Western European ancestry from the CEPH collection (CEU) sample, and 6 in Yoruban in Ibadan, Nigeria (YRI) sample. The 12 common qualified SNPs in the four samples formed one haplotype in each sample. There were 3, 3, 5, and 6 forms of haplotypes in the CHB, JPT, CEU, and YRI samples respectively, and the cumulative frequencies for the 2 most common haplotypes ranged from 0.634 to 0.922.

Since then, seven other African countries have reported H5N1 infections. This study reports a comparison of full-length genomic sequences of H5N1 isolates from seven chicken farms in Nigeria and chicken and hooded vultures in Burkina Faso with earlier H5N1 outbreaks worldwide. In addition, the antigenicity of Nigerian H5N1 isolates was compared with earlier strains. All African strains clustered within three sublineages denominated A (south-west Nigeria, Niger), B (south-west Nigeria, Egypt, Djibouti) and C (northern Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Sudan, Côte d'Ivoire), with distinct nucleotide and amino acid signatures and distinct geographical distributions within Africa. Probable non-African ancestors within the west Asian/Russian/European lineage distinct from the south-east Asian lineages were identified for each sublineage. All reported human cases in Africa were caused by sublineage B. Substitution rates were calculated on the basis of sequences from 11 strains from a single farm in south-west Nigeria. As H5N1 emerged essentially at the same time in the north and south-west of Nigeria, the substitution rates confirmed that the virus probably did not spread from the north to the south, given the observed sequence diversity, but that it entered the country via three independent introductions. The strains from Burkina Faso seemed to originate from northern Nigeria.

METHODS: pol gene sequences were obtained using Illumina next-generation sequencing from 425 INSTI-naive HIV-infected adults from Kenya (21.2%), Nigeria (7.3%), South Africa (22.8%), Uganda (25.2%) and Zambia (23.5%). Drug resistance interpretation was based on the IAS 2017 mutation list and accessory mutations from Stanford HIVdb with resistance penalty scores of ≥10 to at least 1 INSTI. Resistance was further classified based on sensitivity thresholds of ≥20% (Sanger sequencing) and 1%-20% for low-frequency variants (next-generation sequencing). RESULTS: Of 425 genotypes, 48.7% were subtype C, 28.5% A, 10.1% D, 2.8% G and 9.9% were recombinants. Major INSTI resistance mutations were detected only at <20% threshold, at a prevalence of 2.4% (2.5% in subtype A, 2.4% C, 0% D, 8.3% G and 2.4% in recombinants) and included T66A/I (0.7%), E92G (0.5%), Y143C/S (0.7%), S147G (0.2%) and Q148R (0.5%). Accessory mutations occurred at a prevalence of 15.1% at the ≥20% threshold (23.1% in subtype A, 8.7% C, 11.6% D, 25% G and 23.8% in recombinants), and included L74I/M (10.4%), Q95K (0.5%), T97A (4%), E157Q (0.7%) and G163R/K (0.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Major INSTI resistance mutations were rare and only occurred at low-level resistance detection thresholds.

"217","Aaron_3","NO","PeerJ","BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus aureus is a human colonizer with high potential for virulence, and the spread of the virulent strains from the colonized hosts to non-carriers in the community is on the increase. However, there are few reports on comprehensive analysis of staphylococcal enterotoxin (SE) genes with clonal lineage in S. aureus in Africa. This is essential because of diversity of cultures and habits of the people. This study analyzed spa types and enterotoxin genes in S. aureus strains previously isolated from the human nostrils, poultry and clinical samples in Southern Nigeria. METHODS: Forty-seven S. aureus isolates were obtained from humans nostrils (n = 13), clinical strains (n = 21) and poultry (n = 13) from previous studies in Southern Nigeria. The strains were analyzed for mecA gene, selected toxins genes (sea, seb, sec, sed, see, seg, seh, sei, sej, sek, sel, sem, sen, seo, sep, seq, ser, seu) and Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) gene (lukS-PV/lukF-PV) by PCR. Population structures of the strains were detected by Staphylococcal protein A (spa) typing. RESULTS: Twenty different spa types were obtained with the highest percentages, 17% observed in spa type t091 from clinical, nasal and poultry samples while t069 was the most prevalent spa type in poultry. Two MRSA were only detected in human strains. The poultry strains had the highest occurrence of SE genes (18%) followed by nasal strains (15%) and clinical strains (10%). Eighty-nine percent of all tested isolates harbored at least one SE gene; seo was the most prevalent (34%) followed by seg (30%) and sea (21%), while sec, see and sej were absent in all strains. Spa type t355 was associated with lukS-PV/lukF-PV gene and complete absence of all studied SE. Sea, seq, seb, sek were associated with spa type t069; sea was associated with t127 while sep was associated with spa type t091. There were coexistences of seo/seg and sei/seg. CONCLUSIONS: The higher carriage of staphylococci enterotoxin genes by the nasal and poultry S. aureus strains suggests a high potential of spread of staphylococcal food poisoning through poultry and healthy carriers in the community. This is the first report of high occurrence of staphylococcal enterotoxins genes in poultry from Nigeria.","Molecular characterization of clonal lineage and staphylococcal toxin genes from S. aureus in Southern Nigeria.","6","e5204","Ayeni FA and Ruppitsch W and Allerberger F"
"224","Aaron_3","NO","BMC genomics","BACKGROUND: Insecticide resistance in Anopheles mosquitoes is threatening the success of malaria control programmes. This is particularly true in Benin where pyrethroid resistance has been linked to the failure of insecticide treated bed nets. The role of mutations in the insecticide target sites in conferring resistance has been clearly established. In this study, the contribution of other potential resistance mechanisms was investigated in Anopheles gambiae s.s. from a number of localities in Southern Benin and Nigeria. The mosquitoes were sampled from a variety of breeding sites in a preliminary attempt to investigate the role of contamination of mosquito breeding sites in selecting for resistance in adult mosquitoes. RESULTS: All mosquitoes sampled belonged to the M form of An. gambiae s.s. There were high levels of permethrin resistance in an agricultural area (Akron) and an urban area (Gbedjromede), low levels of resistance in mosquito samples from an oil contaminated site (Ojoo) and complete susceptibility in the rural Orogun location. The target site mutation kdrW was detected at high levels in two of the populations (Akron f = 0.86 and Gbedjromede f = 0.84) but was not detected in Ojoo or Orogun. Microarray analysis using the Anopheles gambiae detox chip identified two P450s, CYP6P3 and CYP6M2 up regulated in all three populations, the former was expressed at particularly high levels in the Akron (12.4-fold) and Ojoo (7.4-fold) populations compared to the susceptible population. Additional detoxification and redox genes were also over expressed in one or more populations including two cuticular pre-cursor genes which were elevated in two of the three resistant populations. CONCLUSION: Multiple resistance mechanisms incurred in the different breeding sites contribute to resistance to permethrin in Benin. The cytochrome P450 genes, CYP6P3 and CYP6M2 are upregulated in all three resistant populations analysed. Several additional potential resistance mechanisms were also identified that warrant further investigation. Metabolic genes were over expressed irrespective of the presence of kdr, the latter resistance mechanism being absent in one resistant population. The discovery that mosquitoes collected from different types of breeding sites display differing profiles of metabolic genes at the adult stage may reflect the influence of a range of xenobiotics on selecting for resistance in mosquitoes.","Expression of the cytochrome P450s, CYP6P3 and CYP6M2 are significantly elevated in multiple pyrethroid resistant populations of Anopheles gambiae s.s. from Southern Benin and Nigeria.","9","538","Djouaka RF and Bakare AA and Coulibaly ON and Akogbeto MC and Ranson H and Hemingway J and Strode C"
"226","Aaron_3","NO","Parasitology research","Trichostrongyles are gastrointestinal parasites that occur globally and can cause subclinical to severe, sometimes life-threatening, infections in ruminants, particularly young animals. Benzimidazoles (BZ) are commonly used for the treatment of gastrointestinal parasites in ruminants. Increasing spread of worm populations with anthelmintics resistance has been reported and is considered a consequence of highly frequent and longstanding use of anthelmintics. To obtain initial information regarding the occurrence of putatively BZ-resistant Nigerian Haemonchus populations, screening based on the molecular analysis of BZ-resistance-associated β-tubulin isotype 1 gene sequence polymorphisms was undertaken. Genomic DNA was isolated from pooled adult Haemonchus sp. from 35 animals from each of the six states of southwestern Nigeria. Sequencing of internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS-2) and external transcribed spacer (ETS) regions was used to determine the Haemonchus species. Pyrosequencing assays were used for detection of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the β-tubulin isotype 1 genes of the worms at codons 200 and 167 (TTC/TAC) or 198 (GAA/GCA). Exclusively, Haemonchus placei was detected and allele frequencies obtained at all three positions showed no evidence for the presence of resistance-related alleles. For Lagos State, pools of 10 worms from 30 different animals were analyzed separately for the codon 200 SNP, successfully excluding the presence of resistance-associated SNPs in very low frequencies. These positive findings, showing absence of elevated frequencies of BZ-resistance-associated β-tubulin alleles, have considerable significance since it suggests that farmers can still rely on the efficacy of this important drug class when used for controlling trichostrongyle infections in cattle in Nigeria.","Absence of detectable benzimidazole-resistance associated alleles in Haemonchus placei in cattle in Nigeria revealed by pyrosequencing of β-tubulin isotype 1.","114","1997-2001","Ademola IO and Krücken J and Ramünke S and Demeler J and von Samson-Himmelstjerna G"

This study compared the diagnostic accuracy of three PCR-based assays that do not only differ in their sequence target, but also in the number of copies of their target region, for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum in 401 individuals living in a malaria-endemic area in Nigeria. Compared to a composite reference generated from results of all the 3 PCR assays, the stevor gene amplification had a sensitivity of 100% (Kappa = 1; 95% CI = 1.000-1.000), 83% (Kappa = 0.718; 95% CI = 0.648-0.788) by SSUrRNA gene PCR and 71% (Kappa = 0.552; 95% CI = 0.478-0.627) by the msa-2 gene amplification. Results from this study indicate that the stevor gene amplification is the most sensitive technique for the detection of P. falciparum.

Isolates were assayed according to standard protocol. The isolates were subjected to molecular techniques to detect blaOXA, blaTEM, blaCTX-M, and blaSHV genes in strains of the A. baumannii isolates. The prevalence of A. baumannii was 8.5% and was most prevalent among patients in the age group 51-60 (36%); the male patients (63.6%) were more infected than their female counterparts. Patients (72.7%) in the intensive care unit (ICU) were most infected with this organism. The isolates showed 100% resistance to both amikacin and ciprofloxacin and 90.9% to both ceftriaxone and ceftazidime, while resistance to the other antibiotics used in this study were: piperacillin (81.8%), imipenem (72.7%), gentamycin (72.2%), and meropenem (63.6%). None of the isolates was, however, resistant to colistin. PCR results showed that blaOXA, blaTEM, and blaCTX-M genes were positive in some isolates, while blaSHV was not detected in any of the isolates. This study has revealed that the strains of A. baumannii isolated are multiple drug resistant. Regular monitoring, judicious prescription, and early detection of resistance to these antibiotics are, therefore, necessary to check further dissemination of the organism.","Multidrug Resistance of Acinetobacter Baumannii in Ladoke Akintola University Teaching Hospital, Osogbo, Nigeria.","6","238-243","Odewale G and Adefioye OJ and Ojo J and Adewumi FA and Olowe OA"

Foodborne outbreaks are often attributed to pork consumption and Salmonella contamination of retail pork is directly linked to the Salmonella prevalence on farm. The widespread use of antimicrobials at different steps of swine production can favor resistant strains of Salmonella. The objectives of this study are to characterize the distribution, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), plasmid, virulence profiles and antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella serovars circulating in selected pig farms. Six hundred fecal samples were randomly collected from nine selected farms in Ilorin, Nigeria. Isolates were analyzed by cultural isolation using selective media, conventional biochemical characterization, serotyping, MLST and whole genome sequencing (WGS). Sixteen samples were positive for Salmonella sub-species, comprising of nine serovars. The antimicrobial susceptibility results revealed low-level resistance against 13 antimicrobial agents. Five strains exhibited resistance to nalidixic acid and intermediate resistance to ciprofloxacin with chromosomal (double) mutation at gyrA and parC while four strains possessed single mutation in parC. Salmonella Kentucky showed double mutation each at gyrA and parC. WGS analysis, revealed eight diverse sequence types (STs), the most common STs were ST-321 and ST-19 (n = 4) exhibited by S. Muenster and S. Typhimurium, respectively. Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP)-based phylogeny analysis showed the 16 isolates to be highly related and fell into 8 existing clusters at NCBI Pathogen Detection.

Trough imatinib blood levels and genotypes were determined in 42 CML patients by an HPLC-UV technique and a Sequenom iPLEX assay, respectively. Statistical analysis of the influence of genetic polymorphisms on standardized trough level detected no significant relationship. However, higher trough levels were observed in two homozygous carriers of CYP2C8*2 while diminished imatinib levels were seen in two homozygous carriers of CYP3A5*7. The study findings suggest that polymorphisms in drug metabolizing enzymes may be significant for imatinib therapy only in instances where all copies of the relevant studied genes are functionally impaired.","Inter-individual variation in imatinib disposition: any role for prevalent variants of CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP3A5 in Nigerian CML patients?","60","216-221","Adehin A and Adeagbo BA and Kennedy MA and Bolaji OO and Olugbade TA and Bolarinwa RA and Durosinmi MA"

A significant characteristic of coagulase-negative staphylococci especially strains isolated from animals and clinical samples is their resistance to routinely used antibiotics although, resistant strains isolated from fermented foods have not been fully reported. METHODS: A total of two hundred and fifty-five CoNS isolates were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility test using the disc diffusion technique. The minimum inhibitory concentration of the isolates to the tested antibiotics was determined using the microbroth dilution method. Methicillin resistant strains were confirmed by detection of methicillin resistant genes (mecA) and also employing cefoxitin screening test. RESULTS: The isolates were confirmed to be methicillin resistant by the detection of mecA genes and the cefoxitin screening test. The isolates demonstrated appreciable resistance to ampicillin (86.7%), sulfomethoxazole-trimethoprim (74.9%), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (52.5%) and oxacillin (35.7%). Methicillin resistance was exhibited by 13 out of the 255 isolates although no mecA gene was detected. It was also observed that the methicillin resistant isolates were prevalent in these traditional foods; iru, kindirmo, nono and wara. CONCLUSION: This study has ameliorated the incidence of multiple antibiotic resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci in Nigerian fermented foods and if not tackled adequately might lead to horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance from food to man.","Antimicrobial resistance in coagulase-negative staphylococci from Nigerian traditional fermented foods.","16","4","Fowoyo PT and Ogunbanwo ST"

With few exceptions, however, the population-specific distribution for many of the identified variants/genes is unclear. Until recently, the extensive genetic and clinical heterogeneity of deafness precluded comprehensive genetic analysis. Here, using a custom capture panel (MiamiOtoGenes), we undertook a targeted sequencing of 180 genes in a multi-ethnic cohort of 342 GJB2 mutation-negative deaf probands from South Africa, Nigeria, Tunisia, Turkey, Iran, India, Guatemala, and the United States (South Florida). We detected causative DNA variants in 25 % of multiplex and 7 % of simplex families. The detection rate varied between 0 and 57 % based on ethnicity, with Guatemala and Iran at the lower and higher end of the spectrum, respectively. We detected causative variants within 27 genes without predominant recurring pathogenic variants. The most commonly implicated genes include MYO15A, SLC26A4, USH2A, MYO7A, MYO6, and TRIOBP. Overall, our study highlights the importance of family history and generation of databases for multiple ethnically discrete populations to improve our ability to detect and accurately interpret genetic variants for pathogenicity.","Spectrum of DNA variants for non-syndromic deafness in a large cohort from multiple continents.","135","953-61","Yan D and Tekin D and Bademci G and Foster J 2nd and Cengiz FB and Kannan-Sundhari A and Guo S and Mittal R and Zou B and Grati M and Kabahuma RI and Kameswaran M and Lasisi TJ and Adedeji WA and Lasisi AO and Menendez I and Herrera M and Carranza C and Maroofian R and Crosby AH and Bensaid M and Masmoudi S and Behnam M and Mojarrad M and Feng Y and Duman D and Mawla AM and Nord AS and Blanton SH and Liu XZ and Tekin M"
