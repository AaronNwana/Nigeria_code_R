Their ages at presentation ranged from a few hours to 13 years, and the majority (72.7%) presented in infancy. The male:female ratio was 1.6:1. Cardiovascular, central nervous and gastro-intestinal malformations accounted for 71.6% of all malformations. The commonest individual system malformations were congenital heart lesions, spina bifida, anorectal malformation and omphalocoele, while the highest case fatality rates were recorded in cases of oesophageal atresia, hydrocephalus, biliary atresia and posterior urethral valve. Overall mortality was 19.4%.

"2","Aaron_1","NO","Molecular ecology","Ten microsatellite loci, four located within and six outside chromosome inversions, were employed to study the genetic structure of Anopheles arabiensis across the ecological zones of Nigeria (arid savannah in the north gradually turns into humid forest in the south). Regardless of location within or outside inversions, genetic variability at all loci was characterized by a reduction in both the number of alleles per locus and heterozygosity from savannah to forest. Across all loci, all but one allele in the forest also occurred in the savannah, whereas at least 78 alleles in the savannah were missing in the forest. Genetic differentiation increased with geographical distance; consequently, genetic distances between zones exceeded those within zones. The largest genetic distances were between localities at the extremes of the transect (range F(ST) = 0.196-0.258 and R(ST) = 0.183-0.468) and were as large as those between A. arabiensis and Anopheles gambiae s.s. Gene flow across the country was very low, so that Nm between the extremes of the transect was < 1. These data suggest that A. arabiensis has extended its range from the savannah into the forest during which it experienced a reduction in effective population size due to sequential founder effects. Gene flow post range expansion appears too restricted by geographical distance to homogenize the gene pool of A. arabiensis across Nigeria.","Population genetic structure of the malaria mosquito Anopheles arabiensis across Nigeria suggests range expansion.","10","2577-91","Onyabe DY and Conn JE"

In this study, the merozoite surface proteins (msp-1, msp-2) and glutamate-rich protein (glurp) of Plasmodium falciparum collected from two communities representing rural and urban settings in Ibadan, southwestern Nigeria were analysed. METHODS: A total of 511 febrile children, aged 3-59 months, whose parents/guardians provided informed consent, were recruited into the study. Capillary blood was obtained for malaria rapid diagnostic test, thick blood smears for parasite count and blood spots on filter paper for molecular analysis. RESULTS: Three-hundred and nine samples were successfully genotyped for msp-1, msp-2 and glurp genes. The allelic distribution of the three genes was not significantly different in the rural and urban communities. R033 and 3D7 were the most prevalent alleles in both rural and urban communities for msp-1 and msp-2, respectively. Eleven of glurp RII region genotypes, coded I-XII, with sizes ranging from 500 to 1100 base pairs were detected in the rural setting. Genotype XI (1000-1050 bp) had the highest prevalence of 41.5 and 38.5% in rural and urban settings, respectively. Overall, 82.1 and 70.0% of samples had multiclonal infection with msp-1 gene resulting in a mean multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 2.8 and 2.6 for rural and urban samples, respectively. Msp-1 and msp-2 genes displayed higher levels of diversity and higher MOI rates than the glurp gene. CONCLUSION: Significant genetic diversity was observed between rural and urban parasite populations in Ibadan, southwestern Nigeria. The results of this study show that malaria transmission intensity in these regions is still high. No significant difference was observed between rural and urban settings, except for a completely different msp-1 allele, compared to previous reports, thereby confirming the changing face of malaria transmission in these communities. This study provides important baseline information required for monitoring the impact of malaria elimination efforts in this region and data points useful in revising current protocols.","Extensive diversity in the allelic frequency of Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface proteins and glutamate-rich protein in rural and urban settings of southwestern Nigeria.","17","1","Funwei RI and Thomas BN and Falade CO and Ojurongbe O"

In order to have adequate information for treatment of S. aureus infections, it is crucial to understand the trends in the antibiotic-resistance patterns. In addition, the occurrence and changes in types of S. aureus, clonal identities, and their geographic spread is essential for the establishment of adequate infection control programmes. In this study, 68 S. aureus isolates obtained from clinical and non-clinical sources in Nigeria between January and April 2009 were characterized using phenotypic and molecular methods. RESULTS: All the S. aureus isolates were susceptible to teicoplanin, vancomycin, phosphomycin, fusidic acid, rifampicin, daptomycin, mupirocin, linezolid and tigecycline. Sixteen percent of the isolates were resistant to oxacillin, while 55% and 72% of isolates were resistant to tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole (cotrimoxazole), respectively (Table 1). There was excellent correlation between the broth microdilution assay and detection of antibiotic resistance genes by the multiplex PCR, in the determination of S. aureus resistance to erythromycin, gentamicin, methicillin and tetracycline. A total of 28 spa types were identified in the study, and the predominant spa type among the methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolates was t084 (13 isolates). The t037-ST241-SCCmecIII type was the only clone identified in Maiduguri (North-East Nigeria) while in South-West Nigeria, diversity among the MRSA isolates (t451-ST8-SCCmecV; t008-ST94-SCCmecIV; t002-ST5-SCCmecV; t064-ST8-SCCmecV) was observed. The toxin genes seh and etd were detected in isolates affiliated with clonal complexes CC1, CC80 and sequence type ST25, respectively. The proportion of PVL-positive isolates among MSSA was high (40%). Most of the PVL-positive MSSA isolates were obtained from wound infections and associated with clonal complexes CC1, CC30, CC121 and with sequence type ST152. CONCLUSIONS: The use of phenotypic and molecular methods provided useful information on antibiotic resistance and molecular diversity of S. aureus in Nigeria. The high proportion of PVL-positive MSSA isolates affiliated to various clonal complexes and detected in all the health institutions is a major concern, both as a source of severe infections and as a potential reservoir that could lead to the emergence of PVL-positive MRSA. This study presents the first baseline information on the nature of the antibiotic resistance genes from S. aureus isolates in Nigeria. There is the need to curtail the spread and establishment of MRSA and PVL-positive MSSA clones in Nigerian health care institutions.","Antibiotic resistance and molecular epidemiology of Staphylococcus aureus in Nigeria.","11","92","Shittu AO and Okon K and Adesida S and Oyedara O and Witte W and Strommenger B and Layer F and Nübel U"

Increased use of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) in lieu of cultures makes obtaining clinical isolates for susceptibility testing difficult and samples collected in commercial transport buffer for NAATs do not preserve viable organism, while molecular methods of assessing antibiotic susceptibility do not require viable organism. We evaluated 243 NG-positive samples in Aptima transport media including urine, oral, and rectal swabs from Nigerian men who have sex with men for markers to penicillinase-producing NG, ciprofloxacin ( GyrA and ParC mutations), and extended spectrum cephalosporins (ESCs, PenA mosaic [allele X], PonA, mtrR, PorB mutations) by real-time PCR. NG DNA was recovered in 75% (183/243) of samples. Of these, 93% (171/183) were positive for at least one resistance marker. We observed a prevalence of dual resistance markers to penicillin and ciprofloxacin at 46.2% (79/171). Six percent of samples (10/171) tested positive for the PenA mosaic (allele X) ESC marker.

Clinically relevant A. baumannii lineages and their carbapenem resistance mechanisms are sparsely described in Nigeria. This study aimed to characterize the diversity and genetic mechanisms of carbapenem resistance among A. baumannii strains isolated from hospitals in southwestern Nigeria. We sequenced the genomes of all A. baumannii isolates submitted to Nigeria's antimicrobial resistance surveillance reference laboratory between 2016 and 2020 on an Illumina platform and performed in silico genomic characterization. Selected strains were sequenced using the Oxford Nanopore technology to characterize the genetic context of carbapenem resistance genes. The 86 A. baumannii isolates were phylogenetically diverse and belonged to 35 distinct Oxford sequence types ((oxf)STs), 16 of which were novel, and 28 Institut Pasteur STs ((pas)STs). Thirty-eight (44.2%) isolates belonged to none of the known international clones (ICs). Over 50% of the isolates were phenotypically resistant to 10 of 12 tested antimicrobials. The majority (n = 54) of the isolates were carbapenem resistant, particularly the IC7 ((pas)ST25; 100%) and IC9 ((pas)ST85; >91.7%) strains. bla(OXA-23) (34.9%) and bla(NDM-1) (27.9%) were the most common carbapenem resistance genes detected. All bla(OXA-23) genes were carried on Tn2006 or Tn2006-like transposons. Our findings suggest that a 10-kb Tn125 composite transposon is the primary means of bla(NDM-1) dissemination. Our findings highlight an increase in bla(NDM-1) prevalence and the widespread transposon-facilitated dissemination of carbapenemase genes in diverse A. baumannii lineages in southwestern Nigeria. We make the case for improving surveillance of these pathogens in Nigeria and other understudied settings. IMPORTANCE Acinetobacter baumannii bacteria are increasingly clinically relevant due to their propensity to harbor genes conferring resistance to multiple antimicrobials, as well as their ability to persist and disseminate in hospital environments and cause difficult-to-treat nosocomial infections. Little is known about the molecular epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance profiles of these organisms in Nigeria, largely due to limited capacity for their isolation, identification, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Our study characterized the diversity and antimicrobial resistance profiles of clinical A. baumannii in southwestern Nigeria using whole-genome sequencing. We also identified the key genetic elements facilitating the dissemination of carbapenem resistance genes within this species. This study provides key insights into the clinical burden and population dynamics of A. baumannii in hospitals in Nigeria and highlights the importance of routine whole-genome sequencing-based surveillance of this and other previously understudied pathogens in Nigeria and other similar settings.","High Genetic Diversity of Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii Isolates Recovered in Nigerian Hospitals in 2016 to 2020.","8","e0009823","Odih EE and Oaikhena AO and Underwood A and Hounmanou YMG and Oduyebo OO and Fadeyi A and Aboderin AO and Ogunleye VO and Argimón S and Akpunonu VN and Oshun PO and Egwuenu A and Okwor TJ and Ihekweazu C and Aanensen DM and Dalsgaard A and Okeke IN"
"12","Aaron_1","NO","Journal of virology","The arenavirus Lassa virus causes Lassa fever, a viral hemorrhagic fever that is endemic in the countries of Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea and perhaps elsewhere in West Africa. To determine the degree of genetic diversity among Lassa virus strains, partial nucleoprotein (NP) gene sequences were obtained from 54 strains and analyzed. Phylogenetic analyses showed that Lassa viruses comprise four lineages, three of which are found in Nigeria and the fourth in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Overall strain variation in the partial NP gene sequence was found to be as high as 27% at the nucleotide level and 15% at the amino acid level. Genetic distance among Lassa strains was found to correlate with geographic distance rather than time, and no evidence of a ""molecular clock"" was found. A method for amplifying and cloning full-length arenavirus S RNAs was developed and used to obtain the complete NP and glycoprotein gene (GP1 and GP2) sequences for two representative Nigerian strains of Lassa virus. Comparison of full-length gene sequences for four Lassa virus strains representing the four lineages showed that the NP gene (up to 23.8% nucleotide difference and 12.0% amino acid difference) is more variable than the glycoprotein genes. Although the evolutionary order of descent within Lassa virus strains was not completely resolved, the phylogenetic analyses of full-length NP, GP1, and GP2 gene sequences suggested that Nigerian strains of Lassa virus were ancestral to strains from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Compared to the New World arenaviruses, Lassa and the other Old World arenaviruses have either undergone a shorter period of diverisification or are evolving at a slower rate. This study represents the first large-scale examination of Lassa virus genetic variation.","Genetic diversity among Lassa virus strains.","74","6992-7004","Bowen MD and Rollin PE and Ksiazek TG and Hustad HL and Bausch DG and Demby AH and Bajani MD and Peters CJ and Nichol ST"

To investigate if urbanization alters the expression of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins, we queried gene microarray data from rural and urban populations living in Morocco (GSE17065). The R Bioconductor packages edgeR and limma were used to identify genes with different expression. The experimental design was modeled upon location and sex. Nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins were identified from the MitoCarta2.0 database. Of the 1158 genes listed in the MitoCarta2.0 database, 847 genes (73%) were available for analysis in the Moroccan dataset. The urban-rural comparison with the greatest environmental differences showed that 76.5% of the MitoCarta2.0 genes were differentially expressed, with 97% of the genes having an increased expression in the urban area. Enrichment analysis revealed 367 significantly enriched pathways (adjusted p value < 0.05), with oxidative phosphorylation, insulin secretion and glucose regulations (adj.p values = 6.93E-16) being the top three. Four significantly perturbed KEGG disease pathways were associated with urbanization-three degenerative neurological diseases (Huntington's, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's diseases) and herpes simplex infection (false discover rate corrected p value (PGFdr) < 0.2). Mitochondrial RNA metabolic processing and translational elongation were the biological processes that had the greatest enrichment (enrichment ratios 14.0 and 14.8, respectively, FDR < 0.5).

In this study, we collected RNA-seq data of children with malaria and COVID-19 infection from the public databases as raw data in fastq format paired end files. A group of six, five and two biological replicates of malaria, COVID-19 and healthy donors respectively were used for the study. We conducted differential gene expression analysis to visualize differences in the expression profiles. Using edgeR, we explored particularly gene expression levels in different phenotype groups and found that 1084 genes and 2495 genes were differentially expressed in the malaria samples and COVID-19 samples respectively when compared to healthy controls. The highly expressed gene in the COVID-19 group we found CD151 gene which is facilitates in T cell proliferation, while in the malaria group, among the highly expressed gene we identified GBP5 gene which involved in inflammatory response and response to bacterium. By comparing both malaria and COVID-19 infections, the overlap of 62 differentially expressed genes patterns were identified. Among them, three genes (ENSG00000234998, H2AC19 and TXNDC5) were highly upregulated in both infections. Strikingly, we observed 13 genes such as HBQ1, HBM, SLC7A5, SERINC2, ATP6V0C, ST6GALNAC4, RAD23A, PNPLA2, GAS2L1, TMEM86B, SLC6A8, UBALD1, RNF187 were downregulated in children with malaria and uniquely upregulated in children with COVID-19, thus may be further validated as potential biomarkers to delineate COVID-19 from malaria-related febrile infection.

Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein2 (PfHRP2) based rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) play a vital role in prompt and accurate malaria diagnosis. However, pfhrp2 gene deletion threatens the RDT test sensitivity. This study reports the presence of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes deletion among parasite isolates in Nigeria. Febrile children were screened using histidine-rich protein (HRP2) specific RDT (SD-Bioline RDT) and microscopy for P. falciparum infections. All RDT negative samples were re-evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The presence of parasite in RDT false negative cases and randomly selected RDT positive cases were validated using PCRs targeting glutamate-rich protein (glurp) and merozoite surface proteins (msp-1 and msp-2). Thereafter, exon 2 of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 were amplified, and Sanger sequenced. A total of 511 febrile children were enrolled out of which 309 (61%) were positive by RDT. The presence of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes were analyzed in 66 PCR positive samples comprising of 31 RDT false negative and 35 RDT true positive randomly selected samples. The pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes failed to amplify in 17% (11/66) and 6% (4/66) samples, respectively. Seven of the eleven samples had only pfhrp2 deletion while four had both pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 deletions. The absence of the pfhrp2 gene may be responsible for the seven RDT false negative cases observed. Three RDT positive cases lacked pfhrp2 whereas pfhrp3 was absent in only four RDT false negative cases. The pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 amino acid repeat sequences were highly diverse. The P. falciparum isolates lacking pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes may be circulating and contributing to RDT false negativity in Nigeria. More studies in larger population and seasonally defined cases will be needed to determine the extent of pfhrp2/3 genes deletion in different geographical areas of Nigeria.","Molecular surveillance of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes deletion in Plasmodium falciparum isolates and the implications for rapid diagnostic tests in Nigeria.","196","121-125","Funwei R and Nderu D and Nguetse CN and Thomas BN and Falade CO and Velavan TP and Ojurongbe O"

The objective of this study was to determine the role of ixodid ticks infesting small ruminants in Plateau State, Nigeria, in the epidemiology of Spotted Fever Group Rickettsiae (SFGR) in the study area. DNA from 130 out of 323 ixodid ticks collected from 179 goats and 121 sheep owned by agro-pastoralists in Plateau State were screened for the evidence of SFGR by molecular methods. Six tick species from four genera were identified: Amblyomma, Hyalomma, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) and Rhipicephalus. Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato (s.l.) was the predominant (54.5%) species among collected ticks.

While over 60 common risk loci have been identified, they explain only a small proportion of the heritability for NSOFCs. Rare variants have been implicated in the missing heritability. Thus, our study aimed to identify genes enriched with nonsynonymous rare coding variants associated with NSOFCs. Our sample included 814 non-syndromic cleft lip with or without palate (NSCL/P), 205 non-syndromic cleft palate only (NSCPO), and 2150 unrelated control children from Nigeria, Ghana, and Ethiopia. We conducted a gene-based analysis separately for each phenotype using three rare-variants collapsing models: (1) protein-altering (PA), (2) missense variants only (MO); and (3) loss of function variants only (LOFO). Subsequently, we utilized relevant transcriptomics data to evaluate associated gene expression and examined their mutation constraint using the gnomeAD database. In total, 13 genes showed suggestive associations (p = E-04).

However, there is currently limited information about oral HPV infections in Nigeria. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to provide information on the occurrence and circulating genotypes of HPV among patients attending three (one government and two private) dental clinics in Ibadan, Nigeria. METHODS: An oral swab was collected from 231 dental clinic attendees in Ibadan between January 2016 and March 2017 and tested for HPV DNA by polymerase chain reaction targeting the E6/7 genes of the virus. RESULTS: Twenty-three of the 231 swab samples were HPV DNA positive comprising 16 mono-infections and seven co-infections in 13 males and ten females. Genotype 16 was present in ten patients, genotype 6/11 in five, Genotype 18 and genotype 33 in four each, genotype 31 in three and genotype 39 in one. Twenty-one cases were high-risk HPV genotypes, while two were low-risk. Samples had co-infection and five had low risk type 6/11 either as single or as co-infection.

At the inception of the COVID-19 pandemic, nasopharyngeal swab sample analysis for COVID-19 diagnosis using the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique was the most widely used. However, due to the high cost and difficulty of sample collection, the number of available sample types for COVID-19 diagnosis is rapidly increasing, as is the COVID-19 diagnostic literature. The use of nasal swabs, saliva, and oral fluids as viable sample options for the effective detection of SARS-CoV-2 has been implemented successfully in different settings since 2020. These alternative sample type provides a plethora of advantages including decreasing the high exposure risk to frontline workers, enhancing the chances of home self-sampling, reducing the cost, and significantly increasing testing capacity. This study sought to ascertain the effectiveness of Saliva samples as an alternative for COVID-19 diagnosis in Nigeria. Demographic data, paired samples of Nasopharyngeal Swab and Drooling Saliva were obtained from 309 consenting individuals aged 8-83 years presenting for COVID-19 testing. All samples were simultaneously assayed for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, N, and E genes using the GeneFinder™ COVID-19 Plus RT-PCR test kit. Out of 309 participants, only 299 with valid RT-PCR results comprising 159 (53.2%) males and 140 (46.8%) females were analyzed in this study using the R Statistical package. Among the 299 samples analyzed, 39 (13.0%) had SARS-CoV-2 detected in at least one specimen type. Both swabs and saliva were positive in 20 (51.3%) participants. Ten participants (25.6%) had swab positive/saliva-negative results and 9 participants (23.1%) had saliva positive/swab-negative results. The percentage of positive and negative agreement of the saliva samples with the nasopharyngeal swab were 67% and 97% respectively with positive and negative predictive values as 69% and 96% respectively.

Despite the genomic heterogeneity within African populations, large-scale candidate gene or linkage and exome studies are lacking. However, current knowledge on neurogenetics in African populations is limited and geographically very uneven. Isolated reports indicate the existence of autosomal dominant or recessive conditions incorporating cerebrovascular, movement, neuromuscular, seizure and motor neuron disorders in Africans. In addition, few African families with neurodegenerative disorders associated with dementia have been characterized in North, West and South Africa. The current insurgency in genomic research triggered by among others the Human Health and Heredity (H3) Africa Initiative indicates that there are unique opportunities to advance our knowledge and understanding of the influence of genomic variation on the pattern, presentations and prognosis of neurological disorders in Africa. These have enormous potential to unmask novel genes and molecular pathways germane to the neurobiology of brain disorders. It would facilitate the development of novel diagnostics, preventative and targeted treatments in the new paradigm of precision medicine.

S. aureus isolates were identified using phenotypic methods and the presence of the nuc gene. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed the presence of the mecA gene and enterotoxin genes. The nuc gene was confirmed in 83 isolates, resulting in a nasal carriage of 52.5% (83/158). The nasal carriage of S. aureus was higher among asthma cases (72.4%), with a significant association of S. aureus nasal carriage observed among asthma cases (OR 0.201, 95% CI 0.063-0.645, p = 0.007).

High sporozoite infection (~19.51%) was found in the An. coluzzii populations. A high pyrethroid resistance was observed with only 1% mortality against deltamethrin, a high LD(50) (96.57 µg/ml), and a high LT(50) (170.27 min, resistance ratio of ~51 compared with the fully susceptible Ngoussou colony).

"37","Aaron_1","NO","Parasites & vectors","BACKGROUND: Insecticide resistance in Anopheles mosquitoes is threatening the success of malaria control programmes. In order to implement suitable insecticide resistance management strategies, it is necessary to understand the underlying mechanisms involved. To achieve this, the molecular basis of permethrin and DDT resistance in the principal malaria vector, Anopheles funestus from inland Benin (Kpome), was investigated. RESULTS: Here, using a microarray-based genome-wide transcription and qRT-PCR analysis, we showed that metabolic resistance mechanisms through over-expression of cytochrome P450 and glutathione S-transferase genes (GSTs) are a major contributor to DDT and permethrin resistance in Anopheles funestus from Kpome. The GSTe2 gene was the most upregulated detoxification gene in both DDT- [fold-change (FC: 16.0)] and permethrin-resistant (FC: 18.1) mosquitoes suggesting that upregulation of this gene could contribute to DDT resistance and cross-resistance to permethrin. CYP6P9a and CYP6P9b genes that have been previously associated with pyrethroid resistance were also significantly overexpressed with FC 5.4 and 4.8, respectively, in a permethrin resistant population. Noticeably, the GSTs, GSTd1-5 and GSTd3, were more upregulated in DDT-resistant than in permethrin-resistant Anopheles funestus suggesting these genes are more implicated in DDT resistance. The absence of the L1014F or L1014S kdr mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel gene coupled with the lack of directional selection at the gene further supported that knockdown resistance plays little role in this resistance. CONCLUSIONS: The major role played by metabolic resistance to pyrethroids in this An. funestus population in Benin suggests that using novel control tools combining the P450 synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO), such as PBO-based bednets, could help manage the growing pyrethroid resistance in this malaria vector in Benin.","Molecular basis of permethrin and DDT resistance in an Anopheles funestus population from Benin.","11","602","Tchigossou G and Djouaka R and Akoton R and Riveron JM and Irving H and Atoyebi S and Moutairou K and Yessoufou A and Wondji CS"

RESULTS: All the V. cholerae O1 biotype El Tor isolates isolated during 2007-2013 were susceptible to fluoroquinolones and tetracycline, the drugs currently used in the treatment of cholera cases in Nigeria. Emergence of CT genotype 7 (Haitian type of ctxB allele) was predominantly seen among Ogawa serotype and the CT genotype 1 (classical ctxB allele) was mostly found in Inaba serotype. Overall, V. cholerae O1 from clinical and water samples were found to be closely related as determined by the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. V. cholerae isolates from Abia, Kano and Bauchi were found to be genetically distinct from the other states of Nigeria.

We sought to understand the molecular epidemiology of TDR and to identify the HIV-1 drug-resistance mutations responsible for TDR in different regions and virus subtypes. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We reviewed all GenBank submissions of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase sequences with or without protease and identified 287 studies published between March 1, 2000, and December 31, 2013, with more than 25 recently or chronically infected ARV-naïve individuals. These studies comprised 50,870 individuals from 111 countries. Each set of study sequences was analyzed for phylogenetic clustering and the presence of 93 surveillance drug-resistance mutations (SDRMs). The median overall TDR prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), south/southeast Asia (SSEA), upper-income Asian countries, Latin America/Caribbean, Europe, and North America was 2.8%, 2.9%, 5.6%, 7.6%, 9.4%, and 11.5%, respectively. In SSA, there was a yearly 1.09-fold (95% CI: 1.05-1.14) increase in odds of TDR since national ARV scale-up attributable to an increase in non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) resistance. The odds of NNRTI-associated TDR also increased in Latin America/Caribbean (odds ratio [OR] = 1.16; 95% CI: 1.06-1.25), North America (OR = 1.19; 95% CI: 1.12-1.26), Europe (OR = 1.07; 95% CI: 1.01-1.13), and upper-income Asian countries (OR = 1.33; 95% CI: 1.12-1.55). In SSEA, there was no significant change in the odds of TDR since national ARV scale-up (OR = 0.97; 95% CI: 0.92-1.02). An analysis limited to sequences with mixtures at less than 0.5% of their nucleotide positions—a proxy for recent infection—yielded trends comparable to those obtained using the complete dataset. Four NNRTI SDRMs—K101E, K103N, Y181C, and G190A—accounted for >80% of NNRTI-associated TDR in all regions and subtypes. Sixteen nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) SDRMs accounted for >69% of NRTI-associated TDR in all regions and subtypes. In SSA and SSEA, 89% of NNRTI SDRMs were associated with high-level resistance to nevirapine or efavirenz, whereas only 27% of NRTI SDRMs were associated with high-level resistance to zidovudine, lamivudine, tenofovir, or abacavir. Of 763 viruses with TDR in SSA and SSEA, 725 (95%) were genetically dissimilar; 38 (5%) formed 19 sequence pairs. Inherent limitations of this study are that some cohorts may not represent the broader regional population and that studies were heterogeneous with respect to duration of infection prior to sampling. CONCLUSIONS: Most TDR strains in SSA and SSEA arose independently, suggesting that ARV regimens with a high genetic barrier to resistance combined with improved patient adherence may mitigate TDR increases by reducing the generation of new ARV-resistant strains. A small number of NNRTI-resistance mutations were responsible for most cases of high-level resistance, suggesting that inexpensive point-mutation assays to detect these mutations may be useful for pre-therapy screening in regions with high levels of TDR. In the context of a public health approach to ARV therapy, a reliable point-of-care genotypic resistance test could identify which patients should receive standard first-line therapy and which should receive a protease-inhibitor-containing regimen.","Geographic and temporal trends in the molecular epidemiology and genetic mechanisms of transmitted HIV-1 drug resistance: an individual-patient- and sequence-level meta-analysis.","12","e1001810","Rhee SY and Blanco JL and Jordan MR and Taylor J and Lemey P and Varghese V and Hamers RL and Bertagnolio S and Rinke de Wit TF and Aghokeng AF and Albert J and Avi R and Avila-Rios S and Bessong PO and Brooks JI and Boucher CA and Brumme ZL and Busch MP and Bussmann H and Chaix ML and Chin BS and D'Aquin TT and De Gascun CF and Derache A and Descamps D and Deshpande AK and Djoko CF and Eshleman SH and Fleury H and Frange P and Fujisaki S and Harrigan PR and Hattori J and Holguin A and Hunt GM and Ichimura H and Kaleebu P and Katzenstein D and Kiertiburanakul S and Kim JH and Kim SS and Li Y and Lutsar I and Morris L and Ndembi N and Ng KP and Paranjape RS and Peeters M and Poljak M and Price MA and Ragonnet-Cronin ML and Reyes-Terán G and Rolland M and Sirivichayakul S and Smith DM and Soares MA and Soriano VV and Ssemwanga D and Stanojevic M and Stefani MA and Sugiura W and Sungkanuparph S and Tanuri A and Tee KK and Truong HM and van de Vijver DA and Vidal N and Yang C and Yang R and Yebra G and Ioannidis JP and Vandamme AM and Shafer RW"

Understanding its underlying molecular basis is critical to implementation of suitable insecticide-based interventions. Here, we established that the tandemly duplicated cytochrome P450s, CYP6P9a/b are driving carbamate and pyrethroid cross-resistance in Southern African populations of the major malaria vector Anopheles funestus. Transcriptome sequencing revealed that cytochrome P450s are the most over-expressed genes in bendiocarb and permethrin-resistant An. funestus. The CYP6P9a and CYP6P9b genes are overexpressed in resistant An. funestus from Southern Africa (Malawi) versus susceptible An. funestus (Fold change (FC) is 53.4 and 17 respectively), while the CYP6P4a and CYP6P4b genes are overexpressed in resistant An. funestus in Ghana, West Africa, (FC is 41.1 and 17.2 respectively). Other up-regulated genes in resistant An. funestus include several additional cytochrome P450s (e.g. CYP9J5, CYP6P2, CYP6P5), glutathione-S transferases, ATP-binding cassette transporters, digestive enzymes, microRNA and transcription factors (FC<7). Targeted enrichment sequencing strongly linked a known major pyrethroid resistance locus (rp1) to carbamate resistance centering around CYP6P9a/b. In bendiocarb resistant An. funestus, this locus exhibits a reduced nucleotide diversity, significant p-values when comparing allele frequencies, and the most non-synonymous substitutions. Recombinant enzyme metabolism assays showed that both CYP6P9a/b metabolize carbamates. Transgenic expression of CYP6P9a/b in Drosophila melanogaster revealed that flies expressing both genes were significantly more resistant to carbamates than controls. Furthermore, a strong correlation was observed between carbamate resistance and CYP6P9a genotypes with homozygote resistant An. funestus (CYP6P9a and the 6.5kb enhancer structural variant) exhibiting a greater ability to withstand bendiocarb/propoxur exposure than homozygote CYP6P9a_susceptible (e.g Odds ratio = 20.8, P<0.0001 for bendiocarb) and heterozygotes (OR = 9.7, P<0.0001). Double homozygote resistant genotype (RR/RR) were even more able to survive than any other genotype combination showing an additive effect. This study highlights the risk that pyrethroid resistance escalation poses to the efficacy of other classes of insecticides. Available metabolic resistance DNA-based diagnostic assays should be used by control programs to monitor cross-resistance between insecticides before implementing new interventions.","The duplicated P450s CYP6P9a/b drive carbamates and pyrethroids cross-resistance in the major African malaria vector Anopheles funestus.","19","e1010678","Mugenzi LMJ and A Tekoh T and S Ibrahim S and Muhammad A and Kouamo M and Wondji MJ and Irving H and Hearn J and Wondji CS"

Nevertheless, the associated risk of the presence of emergent foodborne pathogens, such as Vibrio parahaemolyticus might be underestimated. The present study was designed to isolate and characterize foodborne V. parahaemolyticus from minimally processed vegetables using culture-based methods and molecular approach. A total of 300 samples were examined from retail outlets between November 2018 and August 2019 from Southern Nigeria. The prevalence of vibrios from the overall samples based on the colonial proliferation of yellow, blue-green and/or green colonies on thiosulfate citrate bile salts sucrose agar was 74/300 (24.6%). An average of two green or blue-green colonies from respective plates was screened for V. parahaemolyticus using analytical profile index (API) 20 NE. Polymerase chain reaction further confirmed the identity of positive V. parahaemolyticus. The counts of V. parahaemolyticus ranged from 1.5 to 1,000 MPN/g.

In order to facilitate the design of future insecticide-based control interventions in the region, this study has established the resistance profile of An. gambiae s.l. populations in two northern Nigeria locations and assessed the contribution of target site resistance mutations. METHODS: Larval collection was conducted in two localities in Sudan savannah (Bunkure and Auyo) of northern Nigeria between 2009 and 2011, from which resulting adult, female mosquitoes were used for insecticides bioassays with deltamethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, DDT and malathion. The mosquitoes were identified to species level and molecular forms and then genotyped for the presence of L1014F-kdr, L1014S-kdr and ace-1R mutations. RESULTS: WHO bioassays revealed that An. gambiae s.l. from both localities were highly resistant to lambda-cyhalothrin and DDT, but only moderately resistant to deltamethrin. Full susceptibility was observed to malathion. An. gambiae, M form (now An. coluzzii), was predominant over An. arabiensis in Auyo and was more resistant to lambda-cyhalothrin than An. arabiensis. No 'S' form (An. gambiae s.s.) was detected. A high frequency of 1014 F mutation (80.1%) was found in An. coluzzii in contrast to An. arabiensis (13.5%). The presence of the 1014 F kdr allele was significantly associated with resistance to lambda-cyhalothrin in An. coluzzii (OR = 9.85; P < 0.001) but not in An. arabiensis. The L1014S-kdr mutation was detected in a single An. arabiensis mosquito while no ace-1R mutation was found in any of the mosquitoes analysed. CONCLUSIONS: The predominance of An. coluzzii and its resistance profile to main insecticides described in this study can guide the implementation of appropriate vector control interventions in this region of Nigeria where such information was previously lacking.","High frequency of kdr L1014F is associated with pyrethroid resistance in Anopheles coluzzii in Sudan savannah of northern Nigeria.","14","441","Ibrahim SS and Manu YA and Tukur Z and Irving H and Wondji CS"

Most of the antibodies used in RDTs also detect PfHRP3. However, false-negative results were reported. Significant variation in the pfhrp2 gene could lead to the expression of a modified protein that would no longer be recognized by the antibodies used in PfHRP2-based RDTs. Additionally, parasites lacking the PfHRP2 do not express the protein and are, therefore, not identifiable. AIMS: This review aims to assess the pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genetic variation or the prevalence of gene deletion in areas where malaria is endemic and describe its implications on RDT use. SOURCES: Publications of interest were identified using PubMed, Google Scholar and Google. CONTENT: More than 18 types of amino acid repeats were identified from the PfHRP2 sequences. Sequencing analysis revealed high-level genetic variation in the pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes (>90% of variation in Madagascar, Nigeria or Senegal) both within and between countries. However, genetic variation of PfHRP2 and PfHRP3 does not seem to be a major cause of false-negative results. The countries that showed the highest proportions of pfhrp2-negative parasites were Peru (20%-100%) and Guyana (41%) in South America, Ghana (36%) and Rwanda (23%) in Africa. High prevalence of pfhrp2 deletion causes a high rate of false-negatives results. IMPLICATIONS: Presence of parasites lacking the pfhrp2 gene may pose a major threat to malaria control programmes because P. falciparum-infected individuals are not diagnosed and properly treated.","Genetic diversity and deletion of Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 and 3: a threat to diagnosis of P. falciparum malaria.","25","580-585","Gendrot M and Fawaz R and Dormoi J and Madamet M and Pradines B"

METHODS: This was a cross sectional survey of 121 pregnant women. Participants were finger pricked, blood drops were collected for rapid diagnosis with P. falciparum histidine-rich protein 11 rapid diagnostic test kit and the ultra-sensitive Alere Pf malaria RDT, Blood smears for microscopy and dried blood spots on Whatman filter paper for molecular analysis were made. Real time PCR targeting the var acidic terminal sequence (varATS) gene of P. falciparum was carried out on a CFX 96 real time system thermocycler (BioRad) in discriminating malaria infections. For each run, laboratory strain of P. falciparum 3D7 and nuclease free water were used as positive and negative controls respectively. Additionally, High resolution melt analyses was employed for genotyping of the different drug resistance markers. RESULTS: Out of one hundred and twenty-one pregnant women sampled, the SD Bioline™ Malaria Ag P.f HRP2-based malaria rapid diagnostic test (mRDT) detected eight (0.06%) cases, the ultra-sensitive Alere™ malaria Ag P.f rapid diagnostic test mRDT had similar outcome in the same samples as detected by the HRP2-based mRDT. Microscopy and RT-PCR confirmed four out of the eight infections detected by both rapid diagnostic tests as true positive and RT-PCR further detected three false negative samples by the two mRDTs providing a sub-microscopic malaria prevalence of 3.3%. Single nucleotide polymorphism in Pfdhps gene associated with sulphadoxine resistance revealed the presence of S613 mutant genotypes in three of the seven positive isolates and isolates with mixed wild/mutant genotype at codon A613S. Furthermore, four mixed genotypes at the A581G codon were also recorded while the other Pfdhps codons (A436G, A437G and K540E) showed the presence of wild type alleles. In the Pfdhfr gene, there were mutations in 28.6%, 28.6%, and 85.7% at the I51, R59 and N108 codons respectively. Mixed wild and mutant type genotypes were also observed in 28.6% each of the N51I, and C59R codons. For the Pfcrt, two haplotypes CVMNK and CVIET were observed. The SVMNT was altogether absent.

The Stroke Investigative Research and Educational Network (SIREN) is a multicenter study involving 16 sites in West Africa. We conducted the first-ever genome-wide association study (GWAS) of stroke in indigenous Africans. METHODS: Cases were consecutively recruited consenting adults (aged > 18 years) with neuroimaging-confirmed ischemic stroke. Stroke-free controls were ascertained using a locally validated Questionnaire for Verifying Stroke-Free Status. DNA genotyping with the H3Africa array was performed, and following initial quality control, GWAS datasets were imputed into the NIH Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) release2 from BioData Catalyst. Furthermore, we performed fine-mapping, trans-ethnic meta-analysis, and in silico functional characterization to identify likely causal variants with a functional interpretation. RESULTS: We observed genome-wide significant (P-value < 5.0E-8) SNPs associations near AADACL2 and miRNA (MIR5186) genes in chromosome 3 after adjusting for hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and cardiac status in the base model as covariates. SNPs near the miRNA (MIR4458) gene in chromosome 5 were also associated with stroke (P-value < 1.0E-6). The putative genes near AADACL2, MIR5186, and MIR4458 genes were protective and novel. SNPs associations with stroke in chromosome 2 were more than 77 kb from the closest gene LINC01854 and SNPs in chromosome 7 were more than 116 kb to the closest gene LINC01446 (P-value < 1.0E-6). In addition, we observed SNPs in genes STXBP5-AS1 (chromosome 6), GALTN9 (chromosome 12), FANCA (chromosome 16), and DLGAP1 (chromosome 18) (P-value < 1.0E-6). Both genomic regions near genes AADACL2 and MIR4458 remained significant following fine mapping.

Variants of the renal sodium channel (ENaC, SCNN1B) account for approximately 6% of resistant hypertension (RHT) in Blacks; other candidate genes may be important. METHODS: Six candidate genes associated with low renin-resistant hypertension were sequenced in Black Africans from clinics in Kenya and South Africa. CYP11B2 was sequenced if the aldosterone level was high (primary aldosteronism phenotype); SCNN1B, NEDD4L, GRK4, UMOD, and NPPA genes were sequenced if the aldosterone level was low (Liddle phenotype). RESULTS: There were 14 nonsynonymous variants (NSVs) of CYP11B2: 3 previously described and associated with alterations in aldosterone synthase production (R87G, V386A, and G435S). Out of 14, 9 variants were found in all 9 patients sequenced. There were 4 NSV of GRK4 (R65L, A116T, A142V, V486A): at least one was found in all 9 patients; 3 were previously described and associated with hypertension. There were 3 NSV of SCNN1B (R206Q, G442V, and R563Q); 2 previously described and 1 associated with hypertension.

METHODS: We assessed the national pretreatment drug resistance prevalence of HIV-infected children aged <18 months in Nigeria, using WHO-recommended HIV drug resistance surveillance protocol. We used remnant dried blood spots collected between June 2014 and July 2015 from 15 early infant diagnosis facilities spread across all the 6 geopolitical regions of Nigeria. Sampling was through a probability proportional-to-size approach. HIV drug resistance was determined by population-based sequencing. RESULTS: Overall, in 48% of infants (205 of 430) drug resistance mutations (DRM) were detected, conferring resistance to predominantly NNRTIs (45%). NRTI and multiclass NRTI/NNRTI resistance were present at 22% and 20%, respectively, while resistance to protease inhibitors was at 2%. Among 204 infants with exposure to drugs for PMTCT, 57% had DRMs, conferring NNRTI resistance in 54% and multiclass NRTI/NNRTI resistance in 29%.

This study represents a replication of this earlier work using enriched cohorts and extending the analysis to include cognitive decline. METHODS: In this longitudinal study of two community dwelling cohorts of elderly Yoruba and African Americans, APOE genotyping was conducted from blood samples taken on or before 2001 (1,871 African Americans & 2,200 Yoruba). Mean follow up time was 8.5 years for African Americans and 8.8 years for Yoruba. The effects of heterozygosity or homozygosity of ε4 and of the possession of e4 on time to incident AD and on cognitive decline were determined using Cox's proportional hazards regression and mixed effects models. RESULTS: After adjusting for covariates, one or two copies of the APOE ε4 allele were significant risk factors for incident AD (p < 0.0001) and cognitive decline in the African-American population (p < 0001). In the Yoruba, only homozygosity for APOE ε4 was a significant risk factor for AD (p = 0.0002) but not for cognitive decline (p = 0.2346), however, possession of an e4 allele was significant for both incident AD (p = 0.0489) and cognitive decline (p = 0.0425). CONCLUSIONS: In this large longitudinal comparative study, APOE ε4 had a significant, but weaker, effect on incident AD and on cognitive decline in Yoruba than in African Americans.

Thus, we investigated the human genome for high-impact mutations that could explain the risk of nsCL ± P in our cohorts. We conducted next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis of 130 nsCL ± P case-parent African trios to identify pathogenic variants that contribute to the risk of clefting. We replicated this analysis using whole-exome sequence data from a Brazilian nsCL ± P cohort. Computational analyses were then used to predict the mechanism by which these variants could result in increased risks for nsCL ± P. We discovered damaging mutations within the AFDN gene, a cell adhesion molecule (CAMs) that was previously shown to contribute to cleft palate in mice. These mutations include p.Met1164Ile, p.Thr453Asn, p.Pro1638Ala, p.Arg669Gln, p.Ala1717Val, and p.Arg1596His. We also discovered a novel splicing p.Leu1588Leu mutation in this protein. Computational analysis suggests that these amino acid changes affect the interactions with other cleft-associated genes including nectins (PVRL1, PVRL2, PVRL3, and PVRL4) CDH1, CTNNA1, and CTNND1. This is the first report on the contribution of AFDN to the risk for nsCL ± P in humans. AFDN encodes AFADIN, an important CAM that forms calcium-independent complexes with nectins 1 and 4 (encoded by the genes PVRL1 and PVRL4).

ESBLs result from mutations in β-lactamases encoded mainly by the bla(TEM),bla(SHV) and bla(CTX-M) genes. The prevalence of ESBL producing bacteria has been on the increase globally, especially its upsurge among isolates from community-acquired infections has been observed. AIM: To determine ESBL prevalence and identify ESBL genes among clinical isolates in Osun State, Nigeria. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out from August 2016 - July 2017 in Osun State, Nigeria. Three hundred and sixty Gram-negative bacteria recovered from clinical samples obtained from both community and healthcare-associated infections were tested. They included 147 Escherichia coli (40.8%), 116 Klebsiella spp (32.2%), 44 Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.2%) and 23 Proteus vulgaris (6.4%) isolates. Others were Acinetobacter baumannii, Serratia rubidae, Citrobacter spp, Enterobacter spp and Salmonella typhi. Disk diffusion antibiotic susceptibility testing was carried out, isolates were screened for ESBL production and confirmed using standard laboratory procedures. ESBLs resistance genes were identified by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). RESULTS: All isolates demonstrated multiple antibiotic resistance. Resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin with clavulanate and erythromycin was 100%, whereas resistance to Imipenem was very low (5.0%). The overall prevalence of ESBL producers was 41.4% with Klebsiella spp as the highest ESBL producing Enterobacteriacaea. ESBL producers were more prevalent among the hospital pathogens than community pathogens, 58% vs. 29.5% (p=0.003). ESBL genes were detected in all ESBL producers with the bla(CTX-M) gene predominating (47.0%) followed by bla(TEM) (30.9%) and bla(SHV) gene was the least, 22.1%. The bla(CTX-M) gene was also the most prevalent in the healthcare pathogens (62%) but it accounted for only 25% in those of community origin. CONCLUSION: A high prevalence of ESBL producing gram-negative organisms occurs both in healthcare and in the community in our environment with the CTX-M variant predominating.

Antimicrobial drugs are readily accessible for use in food animal production in Nigeria. Beef cattle and abattoir environments harbor pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia coli (E. coli) which have developed resistance to antimicrobial agents used for prophylaxis or treatment. This study investigated the zoonotic transmission of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli (ESBL-EC) among humans, beef cattle, and abattoir environments in Abuja and Lagos, Nigeria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study among abattoir workers, beef cattle, and abattoir environments in Abuja and Lagos. Stool, cecal, and environmental samples were collected from apparently healthy workers, slaughtered cattle, and abattoir environments from May to December 2020. Data were collected electronically using open data kit app installed on a mobile phone. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were determined using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method against a panel of 16 antimicrobial agents. Phenotypic and genotypic characterizations of the isolates were conducted. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics. RESULTS: From 21.7% (n = 97) of 448 samples, ESBL-EC were isolated and further characterized. Prevalence of ESBL-EC was highest in cattle (45.4%; n = 44), abattoir workers (41.2%; n = 40), and abattoir environment (13.4%; n = 13). Whole-genome sequencing of ESBL-EC showed dissemination of blaCTX-M-15 (90.7%; n = 88); blaCTX-M-14 (5.2%; n = 5); and blaCTX-M-55 (2.1%; n = 2) genes. The blaCTX-M-15 coexisted with blaCTX-M-14 and blaTEM-1 genes in 2.1% (n = 2) and 39.2% (n = 38) of the isolates, respectively. The presence of blaCTX-M-14 and blaCTX-M-15 genes was significantly associated with isolates originating from abattoir workers when compared with beef cattle isolates (p = 0.05; p < 0.01). The most prevalent sequence types (ST) were ST10 (n = 11), ST215 (n = 7), ST4684 (n = 7), and ST2178 (n = 6). ESBL-EC strain (ST205/B1) harbored mcr-1.1 and blaCTX-M15 and was isolated from a worker at Lagos abattoir. In 91 ESBL-EC isolates, 219 mobile genetic elements (MGEs) harbored resistance genes out of which β-lactam genes were carried on 64 different MGEs. Isolates showed equal distribution of insertion sequences and miniature inverted repeats although only a few composite transposons were detected (humans n = 12; cattle n = 9; environment n = 4). Two isolates of human and cattle origin (ST46/A) harboring ESBL genes and carried by MGEs were clonally related. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of blaCTX-M-55 gene in humans and cattle in Nigeria. This study demonstrates the horizontal transfer of ESBL genes possibly by MGEs and buttresses the importance of genomic surveillance. Healthcare workers should be sensitized that people working closely with cattle or in abattoir environments are a high-risk group for fecal carriage of ESBL-EC when compared with the general population.","Extended-Spectrum ß-Lactamase-Producing Escherichia coli Among Humans, Beef Cattle, and Abattoir Environments in Nigeria.","12","869314","Aworh MK and Ekeng E and Nilsson P and Egyir B and Owusu-Nyantakyi C and Hendriksen RS"

Contaminated poultry can lead to disease outbreaks in consumers causing massive economic losses in the poultry industry. Additionally, commensal E. coli can harbor antibiotic resistance genes that can be transferred to other bacteria, including pathogens, in a colonized human host. In a previous study on antimicrobial resistance of E. coli from food animals from Nigeria, multidrug-resistant E. coli were detected. Three of those isolates were selected for further study using whole-genome sequencing due to the extensive drug resistance exhibited. All of the isolates carried the extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) genes, bla(CTX-M15) and bla(TEM-1), whereas one isolate harbored an additional ESBL, bla(OXA-1). All of the tetracycline-resistant isolates carried tet(A). The genes aac3-IIa and aacA4, conferring resistance to aminoglycosides, were identified in an E. coli isolate resistant to gentamicin and tobramycin. In two E. coli isolates, dfrA14, qnrS1, and sulII, were detected conferring resistance to trimethoprim, fluoroquinolones, and sulfonamides, respectively. The third isolate carried dfrA17, no fluoroquinolone resistance gene, an additional sulI gene, and a chloramphenicol resistance gene, catB3. Mutations in candidate genes conferring resistance to fosfomycin and fluoroquinolones were also detected. Several efflux systems were detected in all the E. coli isolates and virulence-associated genes related to serum resistance, motility, and adhesion. E. coli and non-E. coli origin prophages were also identified in the isolates.

The burden is further exacerbated in developing countries like Nigeria, by poor diagnosis, management and treatment, as well as rapid emergence of drug-resistant TB. This study was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of drug-resistant TB, determine the rpoB gene mutation patterns of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and model the dynamics of multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB) in Enugu, Nigeria. METHODOLOGY: A total of 868 samples, from patients accessing DOTS services in designated centres within the zone, were screened by sputum-smear microscopy, while 207 samples were screened by Nucleic Acid Amplification (Xpert® MTB/Rif) Test (NAAT). A deterministic model was formulated to study the transmission dynamics of TB and MDR-TB, using live data generated through epidemiological study. RESULTS: The results showed TB prevalence values of 22.1% and 21.3% by sputum-smear and NAAT assays, respectively. Analysis of the rifampicin resistance patterns showed the highest occurrence of mutations (50%) along codons 523 - 527. Factors such as combination therapy, multiple therapy and compliance to treatment had influence on both prevalence and development of TB drug resistance in the population. CONCLUSIONS: This first documentation of Rifampicin resistance patterns in MTB from Nigeria shows that a majority of rpoB gene mutations occurred along codons 523 to 527, contrary to the widely reported codon 531 mutation and that multiple interventions such as combination therapy, with good compliance to treatment are needed to reduce both prevalence and development of TB drug resistance in the population.","Rifampicin resistance patterns and dynamics of tuberculosis and drug-resistant tuberculosis in Enugu, South Eastern Nigeria.","14","1011-1018","Ugwu KO and Onah IS and Mbah GC and Ezeonu IM"

The use of agricultural pesticides may have a profound impact on the development of resistance in the field populations of malaria vectors. Our study focused on insecticide resistance and knockdown resistance (kdr) of Anopheles arabiensis populations from Northern Sudan, related to agricultural pesticide usage. RESULTS: Anopheles arabiensis from urban and rural localities (Merowe and Al-hamadab) were fully susceptible to bendiocarb 0.1% and permethrin 0.75% insecticides while resistant to DDT 4% and malathion 5%. The population of laboratory reference colony F189 from Dongola showed a mortality of 91% to DDT (4%) and fully susceptible to others. GLM analysis indicated that insecticides, sites, site type, and their interaction were determinant factors on mortality rates (P < 0.01). Except for malathion, mortality rates of all insecticides were not significant (P > 0.05) according to sites. Mortality rates of malathion and DDT were varied significantly (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.05 respectively) by site types, while mortality rates of bendiocarb and permethrin were not significant (P >0.05). The West African kdr mutation (L1014F) was found in urban and rural sites. Even though, the low-moderate frequency of kdr (L1014F) mutation was observed. The findings presented here for An. arabiensis showed no correlation between the resistant phenotype as ascertained by bioassay and the presence of the kdr mutation, with all individuals tested except the Merowe site which showed a moderate association with DDT (OR= 6 in allelic test), suggesting that kdr genotype would be a poor indicator of phenotypic resistance. CONCLUSION: The results provide critical pieces of information regarding the insecticide susceptibility status of An. arabiensis in northern Sudan. The usage of the same pesticides in agricultural areas seemed to affect the Anopheles susceptibility when they are exposed to those insecticides in the field. The kdr mutation might have a less role than normally expected in pyrethroids resistance; however, other resistance genes should be in focus. These pieces of information will help to improve the surveillance system and The implication of different vector control programs employing any of these insecticides either in the treatment of bed nets or for indoor residual spraying would achieve satisfactory success rates.","Status of insecticide susceptibility in Anopheles arabiensis and detection of the knockdown resistance mutation (kdr) concerning agricultural practices from Northern Sudan state, Sudan.","19","49","Korti MY and Ageep TB and Adam AI and Shitta KB and Hassan AA and Algadam AA and Baleela RM and Saad HA and Abuelmaali SA"

This study investigated the genetic characteristics of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) from 26 reported outbreaks in 2019 in Nigeria. Nucleotide sequences of VP2 hypervariable (hvVP2) region (n=26) and VP1 (n=23) of Nigerian IBDVs were determined. Our results revealed the detection of reassortant strains with segment A related to very virulent IBDV (vvIBDV) having virulence marker (222A, 242I, 256I, 294I and 299S), whereas their segment B were closely related to previously detected IBDV strains having QEG substitution at positions 145-147. Phylogenetic analysis of the hvVP2 region revealed that all the Nigerian IBDV clustered with vvIBDV (genogroup 3) and were independent of the Asian/European lineage. Interestingly, in the hvVP2, all the viruses had a G-S substitution at residue 254. Additionally, one isolate had an A321T substitution at the P(HI) loop, which has been suggested to play a key role in antigenicity. Four of the viruses (Bauchi=3 and Plateau=1) had a unique A-T substitution at residue 144 on the VP1 region. We also observed a T174S substitution in nine of the Nigerian viruses from Bauchi and Plateau state that were not found in any outbreak viruses from Oyo and Akwa Ibom. This report demonstrates the circulation of reassortant strains in commercial and backyard poultry farms in Nigeria despite sustained vaccination efforts. Our data suggest that the Nigerian outbreak viruses have mutations that may affect antigenicity and contribute to antigenic drift.","Infectious bursal disease in Nigeria: continuous circulation of reassortant viruses.","53","271","Arowolo OA and George UE and Luka PD and Maurice NA and Atuman YJ and Shallmizhili JJ and Shittu I and Oluwayelu DO"

Beta thalassaemia trait (BTT) was screened for in patients with unexplained recurrent haemolytic anaemia and healthy individuals. METHODS: beta-thalassaemia trait (BTT) was screened for using MCH and HbA2 of 27 pg and 3.5% respectively as cut off in 151 Nigerians which included 29 patients and 122 apparently healthy individuals. The subjects were categorized into four, Group I (high HbA2, low MCH), Group II (low HbA2 and MCH), Group III (high HbA2 and high/normal MCH) and Group IV (normal HbA2 and MCH). RESULTS: Group I are possible carriers of BTT while group IV are least likely to carry either alpha or beta thalassaemia genes. There were 36 (26%), 39 (28%), 27 (19%) and 38 (27%) in groups I-IV respectively. The mean MCH, MCV, haematocrit and HbA2 for the study population were 26 +/-2.8, 81 +/- 7.9, 37.5 +/- 6.8 and 3.4 +/- 1.7 respectively. The mean MCV and haematocrit were significantly lower for group I compared to group IV (76.9 Vs 86.6, p = 0.00) and (36.5Vs39.7, p = 0.03) respectively. Group II had significantly lower MCV and haematocrit than group IV (75.4 (p = 0.00) and 36.4 (p = 0.01) respectively. There was a positive correlation between the MCH and MCV with the haematocrit (p = 0.004, p = 0.001 respectively) but HbA2 showed a stronger negative correlation with the haematocrit (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: This does not only show the presence of BTT, but a higher prevalence than previously thought, mutations responsible for it should therefore be characterized.","Beta thalassaemia in Nigeria: myth or fact?","42","355-8","Kotila TR"

Here, we consider the possibility that mutations in the viral genome may be responsible for its changed characteristics. METHODS AND RESULTS: Six genome sequences of isolates from the current outbreak were compared to five genomes of isolates from the 2017 outbreak in Nigeria and to two historic genomes, all belonging to the West-African clade. We report differences that are consistently present in the 2022 isolates but not in the others. Although some variation in repeat units was observed, only two were consistently found in the 2022 genomes only, and these were located in intergenic regions. A total of 55 single nucleotide polymorphisms were consistently present in the 2022 isolates compared to the 2017 isolates. Of these, 25 caused an amino acid substitution in a predicted protein. CONCLUSIONS: The nature of the substitution and the annotation of the affected protein identified potential candidates that might affect the virulence of the virus. These included the viral DNA helicase and transcription factors.

To achieve this goal, efficient interventions that promote treatment adherence are needed. This study was aimed at exploring the impact of peer-education on virological outcomes in Northern Nigeria. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) among patients receiving antiretroviral treatment was conducted in 2 phases between August 2006 and January 2008 in the ""largely Muslim"" Northern Nigeria. Participants were randomized into one of three intervention arms: standard of care arm, a second arm which included daily reminders via alarm and follow-up calls from peer-educators, and adherence support by a home-based treatment partner; and a third arm which included second arm activities, plus home visits by peer-educators. We evaluated sociodemographic factors and adherence levels, measured using self-report and pharmacy (Rx) refill rates, as risk factors for viral load (VL) suppression. RESULTS: Of the 600 participants (43% males), 276 were observed till the end of the study. There were no significant differences in mean log 10 VL between the intervention groups. At the end of entire follow-up period, 83% (229/276) who were not lost to follow-up achieved undetectable VL (< 400 copies/ml). In the multivariable analysis, age between 30-34 years (vs 18-24 years) and both baseline CD4 ranges between 100-199 cells/mm(3) or 200-349 cells/mm(3) (vs CD4 <100 cells/mm(3)) as positively associated with VL suppression while poor self-reported adherence and <95% Rx refill rates were negatively associated with VL suppression. CONCLUSION: High levels of viral suppression and low prevalence of drug resistance mutations (DRMs) were seen in this cohort participating in an ART adherence study in Northern Nigeria. Self-reported good adherence and optimal Rx refill rates were reported as significant predictors of VL suppression. Our findings indicate that ART adherence will improve significantly regardless of whether HIV-infected adults received peer-education-based medication adherence interventions or standard of care services.","Socio-Demographic and Adherence Factors Associated with Viral Load Suppression in HIV-Infected Adults Initiating Therapy in Northern Nigeria: A Randomized Controlled Trial of a Peer Support Intervention.","13","279-85","Coker M and Etiebet MA and Chang H and Awwal G and Jumare J and Musa BM and Babashani M and Habib AG and Dakum P and Abimiku AG and Charurat ME and Blattner WA and Eng M and Ndembi N"

We conducted the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify variants associated with cervical hrHPV infection and persistence. METHODS: Participants were 517 Nigerian women evaluated at baseline and 6 months follow-up visits for HPV. HPV was characterized using SPF(10)/LiPA(25). hrHPV infection was positive if at least one carcinogenic HPV genotype was detected in a sample provided at the baseline visit and persistent if at least one carcinogenic HPV genotype was detected in each of the samples provided at the baseline and follow-up visits. Genotyping was done using the Illumina Multi-Ethnic Genotyping Array (MEGA) and imputation was done using the African Genome Resources Haplotype Reference Panel. Association analysis was done for hrHPV infection (125 cases/392 controls) and for persistent hrHPV infection (51 cases/355 controls) under additive genetic models adjusted for age, HIV status and the first principal component (PC) of the genotypes. RESULTS: The mean (±SD) age of the study participants was 38 (±8) years, 48% were HIV negative, 24% were hrHPV positive and 10% had persistent hrHPV infections. No single variant reached genome-wide significance (p < 5 X 10(- 8)). The top three variants associated with hrHPV infections were intronic variants clustered in KLF12 (all OR: 7.06, p = 1.43 × 10(- 6)).

We characterized 75 P. malariae isolates from seven endemic countries in sSA using highly divergent microsatellites. The P. malariae infections were highly diverse and five subpopulations from three ancestries (independent of origin of isolates) were determined. Sequences of 11 orthologous antimalarial resistance genes, identified low frequency single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), strong linkage disequilibrium between loci that may be due to antimalarial drug selection. At least three sub-populations were detectable from a subset of denoised SNP data from mostly the mitochondrial cytochrome b coding region.

The aim of the present study was to determine the diversity of Diplostomum metacercariae in South African fishes applying molecular and traditional morphological techniques. To achieve this aim, a total of 216 fishes belonging to 21 species collected in the Rivers Phongolo, Riet, Usuthu and Mooi in three provinces of South Africa were examined.

The COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates are low in Nigeria compared to global trends. This research mapped the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in Nigeria and globally to determine whether the Nigerian isolates are genetically distinct from strains circulating in regions of the world with a high disease burden. METHODS: Bayesian phylogenetics using BEAST 2.0, genetic similarity analyses, and genomewide mutational analyses were used to characterize the strains of SARS-CoV-2 isolated in Nigeria. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated in Nigeria showed multiple lineages and possible introductions from Europe and Asia. Phylogenetic clustering and sequence similarity analyses demonstrated that Nigerian isolates were not genetically distinct from strains isolated in other parts of the globe. Mutational analysis demonstrated that the D614G mutation in the spike protein, the P323L mutation in open reading frame 1b (and more specifically in NSP12), and the R203K/ G204R mutation pair in the nucleocapsid protein were most prevalent in the Nigerian isolates.

It contributes to the high mortality-to-incidence ratio reported in West Africa and Asia largely due to low screening. The mortality risk is determined or predicted based on the prevalence of high-risk or aggressive PCa using a scoring or grading system such as Gleason score (GS), Gleason grade (GG), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level. In this review, peer-reviewed articles found on databases such as Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed Central and, EMBASE were selected based on adherence to clinical guidelines for the classification of PCa. In West Africa and Asia, the result revealed that the frequency of high-risk PCa was 42% and 51.2% based on GS, 48.8% and 25.3% based on GG pattern, and 87.5% and 44.3% based on PSA level >10 ng/mL, respectively. Data revealed a high prevalence of high-risk PCa both in West Africa and Asia when compared with developed countries. However, the prevalence of high-risk PCa is higher in West Africa than in Asia. Studies have shown that high-risk PCas are associated with germline mutations and such mutations are prevalent in blacks and Asians than in whites. Thus, testing for germline mutations in patients with GS of ≥ 7, GG ≥ 3, high prostate density, low prostate volume, and PSA levels of >4.0 ng/mL may identify those at risk of developing lethal PCa and could reduce the mortality rates in Asia and West Africa.","High mortality risk of prostate cancer patients in Asia and West Africa: A systematic review.","10","93-101","Okoye JO"

Prostate enlargement is a common occurrence in male aging; however, this enlargement can lead to lower urinary tract symptoms that negatively impact quality of life. This impact is disproportionately present in men of African ancestry. BPH pathophysiology is poorly understood and studies examining non-European populations are lacking. METHODS: In this study, NGRn BPH, normal prostate, and prostate cancer (PCa) tumor samples were sequenced and compared to characterize genetic alterations in NGRn BPH. RESULTS: Two hundred and two nonbenign, ClinVar-annotated germline variants were present in NGRn BPH samples. Six genes [BRCA1 (92%), HSD3B1 (85%), TP53 (37%), PMS2 (23%), BARD1 (20%), and BRCA2 (17%)] were altered in at least 10% of samples; however, compared to NGRn normal and tumor, the frequency of alterations in BPH samples showed no significant differences at the gene or variant level. BRCA2_rs11571831 and TP53_rs1042522 germline alterations had a statistically significant co-occurrence interaction in BPH samples. In at least two BPH samples, 173 genes harbored somatic variants known to be clinically actionable. Three genes (COL18A1, KIF16B, and LRP1) showed a statistically significant (p < 0.05) higher frequency in BPH. NGRn BPH also had five gene pairs (PKD1/KIAA0100, PKHD1/PKD1, DNAH9/LRP1B, NWD1/DCHS2, and TCERG1/LMTK2) with statistically significant co-occurring interactions. Two hundred and seventy-nine genes contained novel somatic variants in NGRn BPH. Three genes (CABP1, FKBP1C, and RP11-595B24.2) had a statistically significant (p < 0.05) higher alteration frequency in NGRn BPH and three were significantly higher in NGRn tumor (CACNA1A, DMKN, and CACNA2D2). Pairwise Fisher's exact tests showed 14 gene pairs with statistically significant (p < 0.05) interactions and four interactions approaching significance (p < 0.10). Mutational patterns in NGRn BPH were similar to COSMIC (Catalog of Somatic Mutations in Cancer) signatures associated with aging and dysfunctional DNA damage repair. CONCLUSIONS: NGRn BPH contained significant germline alteration interactions (BRCA2_rs11571831 and TP53_rs1042522) and increased somatic alteration frequencies (LMTK2, LRP1, COL18A1, CABP1, and FKBP1C) that impact apoptosis.

However, insecticide resistance, among other factors, is responsible for a recent rebound in malaria transmission in 2015-2016, threatening the progress so far made. As a contribution towards understanding patterns of resistance and its mechanism in the field we characterized a population of Anopheles gambiae (s.l.) from Gounougou, a Guinea savanna of north/central Cameroon. RESULTS: Indoor collection conducted in September 2017 identified Anopheles coluzzii and Anopheles arabiensis as the unique Anopheles vector species, with abundances of 83 and 17%, respectively. Analysis of infection with TaqMan assays using heads/thoraces of indoor collected females of An. coluzzii revealed a low Plasmodium falciparum parasite rate of 4.7%. Bioassays conducted with female An. coluzzii revealed extreme resistance, with low mortalities of only 3.75 ± 1.25%, 3.03 ± 1.59% and 1.45 ± 1.45%, respectively, for permethrin, deltamethrin and DDT. In contrast, high susceptibility was obtained with the organophosphates and carbamates, with mortalities in the range of 98-100%. Synergist assays with piperonyl butoxide (PBO) recovered some susceptibility with increased mortality for permethrin to 14.88 ± 8.74%, and for deltamethrin to 32.50 ± 10.51% (~27-fold increase compared to mortalities with deltamethrin alone, χ(2) = 29, df = 1, P < 0.0001). These correlated with the results of cone bioassays which revealed complete loss of efficacy of Olyset®Net (0% mortality) and PermaNet®2.0 (0% mortality), and the considerable loss of efficacy of Olyset®Plus (mortality of 2 ± 2%), PermaNet®3.0 side panel (mortality of 2 ± 2%) and PermaNet3.0® roof (mortality of 16 ± 5.1%). Time-course bioassays conducted with deltamethrin established a high intensity of resistance, with LT(50) of 309.09 (95% CI 253.07-393.71, Fiducial), and a resistance ratio of 93.09 compared with the fully susceptible Ngoussou laboratory colony. TaqMan genotyping revealed a high frequency of the 1014F allele (65.25%) in the An. coluzzii populations.

HOXB13 X285K was associated with 2.4-fold increased odds of prostate cancer (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.5-3.9, p = 2 × 10(-4)), with greater risk observed for more aggressive and advanced disease (Gleason ≥8: odds ratio [OR] = 4.7, 95% CI = 2.3-9.5, p = 2 × 10(-5); stage T3/T4: OR = 4.5, 95% CI = 2.0-10.0, p = 2 × 10(-4); metastatic disease: OR = 5.1, 95% CI = 1.9-13.7, p = 0.001). We estimated that the allele arose in West Africa 1500-4600 yr ago. Further analysis is needed to understand how the HOXB13 X285K variant impacts the HOXB13 protein and function in the prostate. Understanding who carries this mutation may inform prostate cancer screening in men of West African ancestry. PATIENT SUMMARY: A rare African ancestry-specific germline deletion in HOXB13, found only in men of West African ancestry, was reported to be associated with an increased risk of overall and advanced prostate cancer. Understanding who carries this mutation may help inform screening for prostate cancer in men of West African ancestry.","A Rare Germline HOXB13 Variant Contributes to Risk of Prostate Cancer in Men of African Ancestry.","81","458-462","Darst BF and Hughley R and Pfennig A and Hazra U and Fan C and Wan P and Sheng X and Xia L and Andrews C and Chen F and Berndt SI and Kote-Jarai Z and Govindasami K and Bensen JT and Ingles SA and Rybicki BA and Nemesure B and John EM and Fowke JH and Huff CD and Strom SS and Isaacs WB and Park JY and Zheng W and Ostrander EA and Walsh PC and Carpten J and Sellers TA and Yamoah K and Murphy AB and Sanderson M and Crawford DC and Gapstur SM and Bush WS and Aldrich MC and Cussenot O and Petrovics G and Cullen J and Neslund-Dudas C and Kittles RA and Xu J and Stern MC and Chokkalingam AP and Multigner L and Parent ME and Menegaux F and Cancel-Tassin G and Kibel AS and Klein EA and Goodman PJ and Stanford JL and Drake BF and Hu JJ and Clark PE and Blanchet P and Casey G and Hennis AJM and Lubwama A and Thompson IM Jr and Leach RJ and Gundell SM and Pooler L and Mohler JL and Fontham ETH and Smith GJ and Taylor JA and Brureau L and Blot WJ and Biritwum R and Tay E and Truelove A and Niwa S and Tettey Y and Varma R and McKean-Cowdin R and Torres M and Jalloh M and Magueye Gueye S and Niang L and Ogunbiyi O and Oladimeji Idowu M and Popoola O and Adebiyi AO and Aisuodionoe-Shadrach OI and Nwegbu M and Adusei B and Mante S and Darkwa-Abrahams A and Yeboah ED and Mensah JE and Anthony Adjei A and Diop H and Cook MB and Chanock SJ and Watya S and Eeles RA and Chiang CWK and Lachance J and Rebbeck TR and Conti DV and Haiman CA"

Interferon Regulatory Factor 6 (IRF6) (OMIM:607199) gene has been associated with the etiology of both syndromic and nonsyndromic orofacial clefts. The aim of this study was to show evidence of potentially pathogenic variants in IRF6 in orofacial clefts cohorts from Africa. METHODS: We carried out Sanger Sequencing on DNA from 184 patients with nonsyndromic orofacial clefts and 80 individuals with multiple congenital anomalies that presented with orofacial clefts. We sequenced all the nine exons of IRF6 as well as the 5' and 3' untranslated regions. In our analyses pipeline, we used various bioinformatics tools to detect and describe the potentially etiologic variants. RESULTS: We observed that potentially etiologic exonic and splice site variants were nonrandomly distributed among the nine exons of IRF6, with 92% of these variants occurring in exons 4 and 7. Novel variants were also observed in both nonsyndromic orofacial clefts (p.Glu69Lys, p.Asn185Thr, c.175-2A>C and c.1060+26C>T) and multiple congenital anomalies (p.Gly65Val, p.Lys320Asn and c.379+1G>T) patients. Our data also show evidence of compound heterozygotes that may modify phenotypes that emanate from IRF6 variants. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that exons 4 and 7 of IRF6 are mutational 'hotspots' in our cohort and that IRF6 mutants-induced orofacial clefts may be prevalent in the Africa population, however, with variable penetrance and expressivity. These observations are relevant for detection of high-risk families as well as genetic counseling. In conclusion, we have shown that there may be a need to combine both molecular and clinical evidence in the grouping of orofacial clefts into syndromic and nonsyndromic forms.","The prevalence, penetrance, and expressivity of etiologic IRF6 variants in orofacial clefts patients from sub-Saharan Africa.","5","164-171","Gowans LJ and Busch TD and Mossey PA and Eshete MA and Adeyemo WL and Aregbesola B and Donkor P and Arthur FK and Agbenorku P and Olutayo J and Twumasi P and Braimah R and Oti AA and Plange-Rhule G and Obiri-Yeboah S and Abate F and Hoyte-Williams PE and Hailu T and Murray JC and Butali A"

This study utilizes a high-throughput 16S rRNA gene-based amplicon sequencing to investigate the variations in bacterial community dynamics in rhizosphere soil (RH), root surface soil (RS), root endophytic bacteria (PE) compartments of Suaeda salsa roots, and adjoining soils (CK) across six locations along the eastern coast of China: Nantong (NT), Yancheng (YC), Dalian (DL), Tianjin (TJ), Dongying (DY), and Qingdao (QD), all characterized by chloride-type saline soil. Variations in the physicochemical properties of the RH compartment were also evaluated. The results revealed significant changes in pH, electrical conductivity, total salt content, and ion concentrations in RH samples from different locations. Notably, the NT location exhibited the highest alkalinity and nitrogen availability. The pH variations were linked to HCO(3)(-) accumulation in S. salsa roots, while salinity stress influenced soil pH through H(+) discharge. Despite salinity stress, enzymatic activities such as catalase and urease were higher in soils from various locations. The diversity and richness of bacterial communities were higher in specific locations, with Proteobacteria dominating PE samples from the DL location. Additionally, Vibrio and Marinobacter were prevalent in RH samples. Significant correlations were found between soil pH, salinity, nutrient content, and the abundance and diversity of bacterial taxa in RH samples. Bioinformatics analysis revealed the prevalence of halophilic bacteria, such as Bacillus, Halomonas, and Streptomyces, with diverse metabolic functions, including amino acid and carbohydrate metabolisms. Essential genes, such as auxin response factor (ARF) and GTPase-encoding genes, were abundant in RH samples, suggesting adaptive strategies for harsh environments. Likewise, proline/betaine transport protein genes were enriched, indicating potential bioremediation mechanisms against high salt stress. These findings provide insight into the metabolic adaptations facilitating resilience in saline ecosystems and contribute to understanding the complex interplay between soil conditions, bacterial communities, and plant adaptation.","High-throughput 16S rRNA gene-based amplicon sequencing reveals the functional divergence of halophilic bacterial communities in the Suaeda salsa root compartments on the eastern coast of China.","942","173775","Jiang H and Okoye CO and Chen X and Zhang F and Jiang J"

In order to demystify the various glomerular diseases that culminate in CGN, performing a kidney biopsy offers a ray of hope. Few studies on renal biopsies have emanated from Nigeria; this study, however, is unique as the histopathological analysis involves light, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopies. METHODS: This study involved two teaching hospitals in Lagos. Patients from these centers, who met the inclusion criteria, underwent real-time renal biopsy; after providing written informed consent. RESULTS: Among the 52 patients analyzed 26, (50%) were males. The mean age was 31.7 ± 12.8, with age range of 13 - 56 years. The most common indication for kidney biopsy was nephrotic syndrome, accounting for 73%. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) was the most frequent histopathological diagnosis seen in 25 patients (48.1%). CONCLUSION: The findings from this study highlight the role that renal biopsy plays in making a concrete diagnosis in nephrology practice in a developing country like Nigeria. As almost 80% of the study population was made up of patients with FSGS and lupus nephritis, it remains to be determined by further studies among our patients, the role that Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL 1) gene mutation will play in the etiology of renal diseases in Nigeria.","Renal histology patterns in a prospective study of nephrology clinics in Lagos, Nigeria.","86 (2016)","119-122","Umeizudike TI and Awobusuyi JO and Amira CO and Bello TB and Mabayoje MO and Adekoya AO and Adelowo OO and Amisu MA"

Thus, familial clustering and disparities in CKD prevalence rates across ethnic and racial groups indicate that the progression of renal disease has a strong genetic component. Mammalian studies have demonstrated a feasible nexus between nutrition and non-genetic exposure (around the time of conception and in epigenetic changes) in the expression of major genes identified in renal organogenesis. The major consequence is a reduction in the number of nephrons, with subsequent predisposition to hypertension and CKD. Identifying these epigenetic changes is crucial (due to their potentially reversible nature), as they may serve as future therapeutic targets to prevent kidney fibrosis and CKD. Despite progress in the field of epigenetics in oncology, research in other subspecialties of medicine is largely experimental with few existing studies regarding the clinical implication of epigenetics in renal disease. Therapeutic trajectories for CKD in children based on the influence of epigenetics may eventually revolutionize the management of this disease.

METHODS: Samples were collected from 73 children and adolescents shortly after T1D onset (Azerbaijan 19, Jordan 20, Nigeria 14, Sudan 20) and 104 matched control subjects of similar age and locale. Genotyping of major T1D susceptibility genes was performed using saliva or blood samples. The bacteriome was profiled by next-generation sequencing of 16S rDNA. Negative binomial regression was used to model associations, with adjustment for the matched structure of the study. RESULTS: A significant positive association with T1D was noted for the genus Escherichia (class Gammaproteobacteria, phylum Proteobacteria), whereas Eubacterium and Roseburia, two genera of class Clostridia, phylum Firmicutes, were inversely associated with T1D. We also confirmed a previously observed inverse association with Clostridium clusters IV or XIVa. No associations were noted for richness, evenness, or enterotypes.

Due to the high demand for live pigs in Nigeria both for restocking and slaughter, live pigs are sold at designated live pig markets (LPM) in the country. This involves movement of pigs over long distances. Despite, reports of ASF outbreaks following restocking of pigs bought from LPMs, there is paucity of information on the role of LPMs in the epidemiology of ASF.

Samples were analysed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Four genes of ASFV positive samples were characterized to identify the circulating genotypes. Results revealed trade activities involving transportation of pigs from these selected markets to 42 major cities and towns in thirteen (13) States of Nigeria. PCR results revealed an overall ASF prevalence of 10.77% (66/613). ASFV was confirmed by PCR in all the selected LPMs with a prevalence rate of 3.13%-23.81%.

METHODS: Parasite genomic DNA was extracted from 129 participants with uncomplicated P. falciparum infections. Isolates were collected from 78 participants in South Africa (southern Africa) and 51 in Nigeria (western Africa). Allelic typing of the msp1 and msp2 genes was carried out using nested PCR. RESULTS: In msp1, the K1 allele (39.7%) was the most common allele among the South African isolates, while the RO33 allele (90.2%) was the most common allele among the Nigerian isolates. In the msp2 gene, FC27 and IC3D7 showed almost the same percentage distribution (44.9% and 43.6%) in the South African isolates, whereas FC27 had the highest percentage distribution (60.8%) in the Nigerian isolates. The msp2 gene showed highly distinctive genotypes, indicating high genetic diversity in the South African isolates, whereas msp1 showed high genetic diversity in the Nigerian isolates.

An in-depth understanding of Pf interaction with various human genes through regulatory elements will pave way for identification of newer tools in the arsenal for malaria control. Therefore, the regulatory elements (REs) involved in the over- or under-expression of various host immune genes hold the key to elucidating alternative control measures that can be applied for disease surveillance, prompt diagnosis and treatment. We carried out an RNAseq analysis to identify differentially expressed genes and network elucidation of non-coding RNAs and target genes associated with immune response in individuals with different clinical outcomes. Raw RNAseq datasets, retrieved for analyses include individuals with severe (Gambia-20), symptomatic (Burkina Faso-15), asymptomatic (Mali-16) malaria as well as uninfected controls (Tanzania-20; Mali-36). Of the total 107 datasets retrieved, we identified 5534 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among disease and control groups. A peculiar pattern of DEGs was observed, with individuals presenting with severe/symptomatic malaria having the highest and most diverse upregulated genes, while a reverse phenomenon was recorded among asymptomatic and uninfected individuals. In addition, we identified 141 differentially expressed micro RNA (miRNA), of which 78 and 63 were upregulated and downregulated respectively. Interactome analysis revealed a moderate interaction between DEGs and miRNAs. Of all identified miRNA, five were unique (hsa-mir-32, hsa-mir-25, hsa-mir-221, hsa-mir-29 and hsa-mir-148) because of their connectivity to several genes, including hsa-mir-221 connected to 16 genes.

Recently, a mutation in the coding region of ICAM-1, termed ICAM-1Kilifi, was described, causing a change from Lys to Met in the loop that interacts with rhinoviruses, lymphocytes, and parasitized red blood cells. Surprisingly, this mutation was shown to increase susceptibility of Kenyan children to severe malaria in one study. When we compared the distribution of ICAM-1Kilifi in two groups of Gabonese children enrolled in a case-control, matched-pair study who presented with either mild or severe malaria, we found that 55% of the patients with mild malaria were carriers whereas only 39% of those with severe malaria were carriers. The difference in the distribution of ICAM-1Kilifi homozygous pairs between the groups, as well as the distribution of ICAM-1Kilifi carriers, was statistically highly significant (P = 0.027 and P = 0.012, by the McNemar test). In a group of healthy school children from the same region, a distribution of 52% ICAM-1Kilifi carriers to 48% wild-type individuals was found. In a survey for the ICAM-1Kilifi in other malaria-endemic regions, this allele was also found in Nigeria and Papua New Guinea, but not in Thailand.","Association of the ICAM-1Kilifi mutation with protection against severe malaria in Lambaréné, Gabon.","61","776-9","Kun JF and Klabunde J and Lell B and Luckner D and Alpers M and May J and Meyer C and Kremsner PG"

This study determined the distinct pattern and prevalence of Pfdhps mutations in children with SCA and in those with homozygous haemoglobin A (HbAA) in Benin City, Nigeria; showing the impact of haemoglobin phenotype. METHODS: this was a cross-sectional study involving children with SCA and HbAA. Those with successfully amplified Pfdhps genes were included in the study. Point mutations and mutant haplotypes of the Pfdhps gene were identified. Parasite density (PD) was determined by estimating the parasite numbers/μl of blood from the thick film. Descriptive, univariable and multivariable analysis were used appropriately. RESULTS: a total of 146 children: 71 with SCA and 75 with HbAA were recruited, with a mean age of 46.6 ± 13.0 and 36.4 ± 17.6 respectively; proportion of males were 45(63.4%) and 43(57.3%) respectively. I431V, S436A, A437G, A581G, and A613G mutations were present; but the K540E mutation was absent. ISGKAA 41(28.1%) and VAGKGS 61(41.8%) were the most prevalent mutant haplotypes in this study. The prevalence of VAGKGS haplotype 43(57.3%) was significantly higher in HbAA group compared to that 18(25.4%) in the SCA group (p < 0.001). The prevalence of ISGKAA in SCA group 25(35.2%) was significantly higher than that 16(21.3%) in the HbAA group (p=0.032). HbAA phenotype was the only significant predictor for the presence of the VAGKGS mutant haplotype (aOR: 3.0, 95%CI: 1.375 to 6.499; p=0.006). CONCLUSION: the HbAA phenotype was a significant predictor for the occurrence of the quintuple mutant haplotype (VAGKGS). The K540E mutation was absent; thus, SP-IPT can be explored in children younger than five years with SCA.","Distinct pattern and prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum dihydropteroate synthase gene mutations in children with sickle cell anaemia and haemoglobin AA in Benin City, Nigeria: the impact of HbAA.","43","80","Enato IG and Sadoh AE and Ibadin OM and Odunvbun ME and Osaigbovo II"

Between 2021 and 2022, HPAI caused 467 outbreaks reported in 31 of the 37 administrative regions in Nigeria. In this study, we characterized the genomes of 97 influenza A viruses of the subtypes H5N1, H5N2, and H5N8, which were identified in different agro-ecological zones and farms during the 2021-2022 epidemic. The phylogenetic analysis of the HA genes showed a widespread distribution of the H5Nx clade 2.3.4.4b and similarity with the HPAI H5Nx viruses that have been detected in Europe since late 2020. The topology of the phylogenetic trees indicated the occurrence of several independent introductions of the virus into the country, followed by a regional evolution of the virus that was most probably linked to its persistent circulation in West African territories. Additional evidence of the evolutionary potential of the HPAI viruses circulating in this region is the identification in this study of a putative H5N1/H9N2 reassortant virus in a mixed-species commercial poultry farm. Our data confirm Nigeria as a crucial hotspot for HPAI virus introduction from the Eurasian territories and reveal a dynamic pattern of avian influenza virus evolution within the Nigerian poultry population.","The Evolution of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A (H5) in Poultry in Nigeria, 2021-2022.","15",NA,"Meseko C and Milani A and Inuwa B and Chinyere C and Shittu I and Ahmed J and Giussani E and Palumbo E and Zecchin B and Bonfante F and Maniero S and Angot A and Niang M and Fusaro A and Gobbo F and Terregino C and Olasoju T and Monne I and Muhammad M"

The extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing bacteria stand out as bacteria of great epidemic concern among Gram negative bacilli. Control and appropriate interventions for antimicrobial resistance depend on effective surveillance and knowledge of the patterns and determinants of resistance. AIM: The present study was undertaken to detect and characterize ESBLs in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella Species from University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital, Maiduguri, North-Eastern Nigeria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Confirmed variants of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella Species isolated from 439 patients that were admitted in various units of University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital (UMTH) were screened for ESBL using CLSI breakpoints. Suspected ESBLs producers were subjected to confirmation using double disk synergy method. Detection of ESBL genes was further done by multiplex PCR. RESULTS: Out of the 439 isolates screened; the result shows 147 (33.5%) were ESBL producers but only 121(23.6%) were confirmed by the double disk synergy method. The prevalence of ESBL amongst the organisms were; 41/172 (23.8%) for Escherichia coli and 80/267/(30.0%) for Klebsiella Species. Based on PCR analysis, the various percentage genotypes of the ESBL producers were 44 (36.4%) for SHV gene followed by 38(31.4%) for TEM gene and the lowest of 33(27.3%) for CTX-M gene. CONCLUSION: ESBLs are prevalent among Species of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella Species in Maiduguri, Borno State, not only are there TEM and SHV but also CTX-M types.

Of these, 69.6% were collected in 9 countries (numbers of isolates are in parentheses): Russia (72), Greece (61), Philippines (54), Venezuela (29), and Kuwait, Nigeria, Romania, South Africa, and Thailand (20 to 25 isolates each). Thirty-two different MBL variants were detected (14 VIM, 14 IMP, and 4 NDM enzymes).

To fill this gap, a One-Health approach was taken by sampling livestock on farms (n = 52), abattoir (n = 8), and animal markets (n = 10), and in-contact humans in Southeast Nigeria. Extended spectrum cephalosporin (ESC)-resistant (ESC-R) Escherichia coli was selectively cultured from 975 healthy livestock faecal swabs, and hand swabs from in-contact humans. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) was performed on all ESC-R E. coli. For isolates showing a multi-drug resistance (MDR) phenotype (n = 196), quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was performed for confirmation of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) and carbapenemase genes. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on a subset (n = 157) for detailed molecular characterisation. The results showed ESC-R E. coli was present in 41.2% of samples, with AST results indicating 48.8% of isolates were phenotypically MDR. qPCR confirmed presence of ESBL genes, with bla (CTX-M) present in all but others in a subset [bla (TEM) (62.8%) and bla (SHV) (0.5%)] of isolates; none harboured transferable carbapenemase genes. Multi-locus sequence typing identified 34 Sequence Types (ST) distributed among different sampling levels; ST196 carrying bla (CTX-M-55) was predominant in chickens. Large numbers of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the core genome of isolates, even within the same clade by phylogenetic analysis, indicated high genetic diversity. AMR genotyping indicated the predominant bla (CTX-M) variant was bla (CTX-M-15) (87.9%), although bla (CTX-M-55), bla (CTX-M-64,) and bla (CTX-M-65) were present; it was notable that bla (CTX-M-1), common in livestock, was absent. Other predominant AMR genes included: sul2, qnrS1, strB, bla (TEM-1b), tetA-v2, and dfrA14, with prevalence varying according to host livestock species. A bla (CTX-M-15) harbouring plasmid from livestock isolates in Ebonyi showed high sequence identity to one from river/sewage water in India, indicating this ESBL plasmid to be globally disseminated, being present beyond the river environment. In conclusion, ESC-R E. coli was widespread in livestock and in-contact humans from Southeast Nigeria. WGS data indicated the isolates were genetically highly diverse, probably representing true diversity of wild type E. coli; they were likely to be MDR with several harbouring bla (CTX-M-15.)

All parts of the world are now considered at risk due to trade globalisation, with the worldwide movement of animals, products and humans, and because of the possible spread of the virus through the migration of wild birds. The risk of introducing notifiable avian influenza (NAI) through trade depends on several factors, including the disease status of the exporting country and the type of products. The highest risk occurs in the trade of live birds. It is important to assess and manage these risks to ensure that global trade does not result in the dissemination of NAI. However, it is also important that the risk of infection is not used as an unjustified trade barrier. The role of the regulatory authorities is thus to facilitate the safe trade of animal products according to international guidelines. Nevertheless, the balance between acceptable risk and safe trade is difficult to achieve. Since the movements of poultry and birds are sometimes difficult to trace, the signature or 'identity card' of each isolated virus can be very informative. Indeed, sequencing the genes of H5N1 and other avian influenza viruses has assisted greatly in establishing links and highlighting differences between isolates from different countries and tracing the possible source of introduction. Recent examples from Asia, Europe and Africa, supported by H5N1 molecular fingerprinting, have demonstrated that the sources of introduction can be many and no route should be underestimated.","The role of the legal and illegal trade of live birds and avian products in the spread of avian influenza.","28","93-111","van den Berg T"

In Nigeria, antimicrobial drugs are readily accessible for use in poultry production, either for preventive or therapeutic purposes. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-EC) are transmissible to humans because of their zoonotic potentials. People working very closely with chickens either on farms or markets are at greater risk. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and zoonotic transmission of ESBL-EC among poultry-workers, chickens, and poultry environments in Abuja, Nigeria. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study among workers, chickens and poultry environment in selected farms/chicken markets in Abuja. Stool, faecal, and environmental samples were collected from apparently healthy workers, chickens, and farm/market environments from December 2018 to April 2019. Data were collected electronically using an open data kit (ODK) installed on a Smartphone. Antimicrobial resistance was determined using broth micro-dilution methods against a panel of 14 antimicrobial agents. We carried out the phenotypic and genotypic characterization of the isolates. Data were analyzed by computing frequencies, proportions and spearman's correlation (ρ). RESULTS: Of 429 samples, 26.8% (n = 115) were positive for Escherichia coli (E. coli). Of the 115 E. coli isolates, 32.2% (n = 37) were confirmed ESBL producers by phenotypic characterization. Prevalence of ESBL-EC was highest among both poultry-workers (37.8%; n = 14) and chickens (37.8%; n = 14) followed by the environment (24.3%; n = 9). Both human and chicken isolates showed similar patterns of multidrug resistance to tested antimicrobials with a positive correlation (ρ = 0.91). Among ESBL producers, we observed the dissemination of blaCTX-M (10.8%; n = 4) genes. The coexistence of blaCTX-M-15 and blaTEM-1 genes was observed in 8.1% (n = 3) of the isolates, out of which (66.7%; n = 2) were chicken isolates from the farm, while a single human isolate was from the chicken market. CONCLUSIONS: ESBL-EC isolates were prevalent amongst apparently healthy individuals, chickens and the poultry farm/market environment in Abuja. It is important to educate healthcare workers that people in proximity with poultry are a high-risk group for faecal carriage of ESBL-EC, hence pose a higher risk to the general population for the spread of antimicrobial resistance.","Extended-spectrum ß-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli among humans, chickens and poultry environments in Abuja, Nigeria.","2","8","Aworh MK and Kwaga J and Okolocha E and Harden L and Hull D and Hendriksen RS and Thakur S"

The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) geometric mean (GM) for all P. falciparum isolates was 1.78 nM (range, 0.03-10.43 nM). Polymorphisms at codons 241, 86, and 76 of PFE0775C, pfmdr1, and pfcrt genes, respectively, were associated with reduced susceptibility to ATH. A new S263P single-nucleotide polymorphism on the PFE0775C gene was also detected in 27% of the isolates. Patient isolates harboring V241L or S263P polymorphisms on the PFE0775C gene showed increased IC(50) (GM: 3.08 nM and 1.79 nM, respectively).

Mn induced DAergic degeneration in wt worms, but not in trt-1 worms. Basal slowing was altered in both wt and trt-1 worms; however trt-1 worms were significantly less affected in their basal slowing behavior compared to wt worms. Mn treatment did not affect chemotaxis by NaCl in either wt or trt-1 mutants worms.

Drugs and drug resistance","There are few published reports of mutations in dihydropteroate synthetase (dhps) and dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) genes in P. falciparum populations in Nigeria, but one previous study has recorded a novel dhps mutation at codon 431 among infections imported to the United Kingdom from Nigeria. To assess how widespread this mutation is among parasites in different parts of the country and consequently fill the gap in sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) resistance data in Nigeria, we retrospectively analysed 1000 filter paper blood spots collected in surveys of pregnant women and children with uncomplicated falciparum malaria between 2003 and 2015 from four sites in the south and north. Genomic DNA was extracted from filter paper blood spots and placental impressions. Point mutations at codons 16, 50, 51, 59, 108, 140 and 164 of the dhfr gene and codons 431, 436, 437, 540, 581 and 613 of the dhps gene were evaluated by nested PCR amplification followed by direct sequencing. The distribution of the dhps-431V mutation was widespread throughout Nigeria with the highest prevalence in Enugu (46%). In Ibadan where we had sequential sampling, its prevalence increased from 0% to 6.5% between 2003 and 2008. Although there were various combinations of dhps mutations with 431V, the combination 431V + 436A + 437G+581G+613S was the most common. All these observations support the view that dhps-431V is on the increase. In addition, P. falciparum DHPS crystal structure modelling shows that the change from Isoleucine to Valine (dhps-431V) could alter the effects of both S436A/F and A437G, which closely follow the 2nd β-strand. Consequently, it is now a research priority to assess the implications of dhps-VAGKGS mutant haplotype on continuing use of SP in seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) and intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp).

The virus causes haemorrhagic Lassa fever and considerable mortality in humans. To date, the role of Mastomys immunogenetics in resistance to, and persistence of, LASV infections is largely unknown. Here, we investigated the role of Major Histocompatibility Complex class I (MHC-I) on LASV infection status (i.e., active vs. cleared infection, determined via PCR and an immunofluorescence assay on IgG antibodies, respectively) in Mastomys natalensis and M. erythroleucus sampled within southwestern Nigeria. We identified more than 190 and 90 MHC-I alleles by Illumina high throughput-sequencing in M. natalensis and M. erythroleucus, respectively, with different MHC allele compositions and frequencies between LASV endemic and non-endemic sites. In M. natalensis, the MHC allele ManaMHC-I*006 was negatively associated with active infections (PCR-positive) and positively associated with cleared infections (IgG-positive) simultaneously, suggesting efficient immune responses that facilitate LASV clearance in animals carrying this allele. Contrarily, alleles ManaMHC-I*008 and ManaMHC-I*021 in M. natalensis, and MaerMHC-I*008 in M. erythroleucus, were positively associated with active infection, implying susceptibility. Alleles associated with susceptibility shared a glutamic acid at the positively selected codon 57, while ManaMHC-I*006 featured an arginine. There was no link between number of MHC alleles per Mastomys individual and LASV prevalence. Thus, specific alleles, but not MHC diversity per se, seem to mediate antibody responses to viremia. We conclude that co-evolution with LASV likely shaped the MHC-I diversity of the main LASV reservoirs in southwestern Nigeria, and that information on reservoir immunogenetics may hold insights into transmission dynamics and zoonotic spillover risks.","MHC-I alleles mediate clearance and antibody response to the zoonotic Lassa virus in Mastomys rodent reservoirs.","18","e0011984","Olayemi A and Schmid DW and Fleischer R and Wilhelm K and Heni AC and Mueller-Klein N and Haikukutu L and Fichet-Calvet E and Günther S and Sommer S"

The current methods of monitoring drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) using clinical diagnoses and hospital records are insufficient due to limited healthcare access and underreporting. This study proposes using Wastewater-Based Epidemiology (WBE) to monitor DR-TB in six African countries (Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, Cameroon, and South Africa) and examines the impact of treated wastewater on the spread of TB drug-resistant genes in the environment. Using droplet-digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR), the study evaluated untreated and treated wastewater samples in selected African countries for TB surveillance. There was a statistically significant difference in concentrations of genes conferring resistance to TB drugs in wastewater samples from the selected countries (p-value<0.05); South African samples exhibited the highest concentrations of 4.3(±2,77), 4.8(±2.96), 4.4(±3,10) and 4.7(±3,39) log copies/ml for genes conferring resistance to first-line TB drugs (katG, rpoB, embB and pncA respectively) in untreated wastewater. This may be attributed to the higher prevalence of TB/MDR-TB in SA compared to other African countries. Interestingly, genes conferring resistance to second-line TB drugs such as delamanid (ddn gene) and bedaquiline (atpE gene) were detected in relatively high concentrations (4.8(±3,67 and 3.2(±2,31 log copies/ml for ddn and atpE respectively) in countries, such as Cameroon, where these drugs are not part of the MDR-TB treatment regimens, perhaps due to migration or the unapproved use of these drugs in the country. The gene encoding resistance to streptomycin (rrs gene) was abundant in all countries, perhaps due to the common use of this antibiotic for infections other than TB. These results highlight the need for additional surveillance and monitoring, such as WBE, to gather data at a community level. Combining WBE with the One Health strategy and current TB surveillance systems can help prevent the spread of DR-TB in populations.","Surveillance of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in sub-Saharan Africa through wastewater-based epidemiology.","9","e18302","Mtetwa HN and Amoah ID and Kumari S and Bux F and Reddy P"

Equine piroplasmosis is widespread in the northern regions of Nigeria, where an increasing portion of the animal population is composed of horses. This disease has remained epidemiologically challenging, especially as the movement of horses increases across Nigeria. In this study, blood samples from 300 horses were collected in three states of northwestern Nigeria. The presence of piroplasms was screened by nested PCR targeting 18S rDNA and positive samples were analyzed using species-specific-nested PCR-targeting genes including ema1 (T. equi), rap1 (B. caballi), and a gene coding a protein of unknown function (T. haneyi). Species-specific-nPCR results demonstrated that the prevalence of T. equi was 13.0% (39/300), B. caballi was 3.3% (10/300) and T. haneyi was 2.7% (8/300). Mixed infections with T. equi and B. caballi was 2.7% (8/300) while T. equi, B. caballi, and T. haneyi multiple infection prevalence was 0.6% (2/300).

The demand for improvement of cassava with respect to these traits comes from both farmers and national agricultural institutions. Genetic improvement of cassava cultivars by molecular biology techniques requires the availability of appropriate genes, a system to introduce these genes into cassava, and the use of suitable gene promoters.

Polymerase chain reaction was used to detect virulence genes, the Epsilometer test to assess antimicrobial susceptibility, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to investigate genetic relatedness of isolates, and conventional serotyping for phenotypic identification. Amongst the 86 STEC isolates, the eaeA gene was detected in 20 (23%), and 26 different serogroups were identified, including the clinically important O8, O174, O2, 020 and O117. The majority of the isolates (95%; 82/86) exhibited resistance to one or more antimicrobial agents, and 30 of the isolates (35%) exhibited multi-drug resistance (MDR), being resistant to at least three antimicrobial classes.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is caused by influenza type A virus subtypes H5, and H7 which are naturally carried by a wild bird and often affect domestic poultry. Avian influenza (AI) is a major problem worldwide that causes significant economic losses in the poultry sector. Since 2003, the widespread H5N1 HPAI in poultry has led to high mortalities resulting in huge economic losses in the poultry sector in Indonesia. Domestic poultry is a key source of income that contributes to economic growth, both directly and indirectly, by reducing poverty among the people living in rural communities. Furthermore, in many developing countries, including Indonesia, rural people meet a portion of their food needs through backyard poultry. Nevertheless, this sector is strongly affected by biosecurity hazards, particularly in Indonesia by HPAI infections. Avian influenza (AI), subtype H5N1 has zoonotic significance, posing major risks to public health and poultry. Due to close interaction between wild migratory birds and ducks, the domestic poultry sector in Indonesia is directly affected by this virus. This virus continues to be ubiquitous in Indonesia as a result of the unpredictable mutations produced by antigenic drift and shift, which can persist from a few days to several years.

RESULTS: Capsular types Ia, Ib, II, III, IV and V were detected among the 43 isolates sequenced. Twelve sequence types (STs) were identified, with ST19 (n = 9, 27.3 %) and ST486 (n = 5, 15.2 %) the most frequent among non-duplicated isolates. Of the alpha-like proteins (alp) identified, Alp1 was the most prevalent in 11 (33.3 %) isolates.

Exposure pathways that were addressed in this review included those relevant to agricultural workers and their families, consumers of crops, and residents close to areas irrigated with wastewater (partially treated or untreated). A meta-analysis gave an overall odds ratio of 1.65 (95% CI: 1.31, 2.06) for diarrheal disease and 5.49 (95% CI: 2.49, 12.10) for helminth infections for exposed agricultural workers and family members. The risks were higher among children and immunocompromised individuals than in immunocompetent adults. Predominantly skin and intestinal infections were prevalent among individuals infected mainly via occupational exposure and ingestion. Food-borne outbreaks as a result of crops (fruits and vegetables) irrigated with partially or untreated wastewater have been widely reported. Contamination of crops with enteric viruses, fecal coliforms, and bacterial pathogens, parasites including soil-transmitted helminthes (STHs), as well as occurrence of antibiotic residues and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have also been evidenced. The antibiotic residues and ARGs may get internalized in crops along with pathogens and may select for antibiotic resistance, exert ecotoxicity, and lead to bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms with high risk quotient (RQ). Appropriate mitigation lies in adhering to existing guidelines such as the World Health Organization wastewater reuse guidelines and to Sanitation Safety Plans (SSPs).

The approach adopted here consisted in comparing the variations of G6PD activity observed between brothers who certainly received their Gd gene from the same grandparent (hence Gd genes identical by descent) with those between brothers who received it (in the Roman series) or may have received it (in the Sardinian series) from different grandparents. No evidence for common moderate G6PD activity variations segregating with the Gd gene was found either in Romans or Sardinians, who have both been studied with much larger samples and more sensitive approaches than those which detected such type of polymorphism among Nigerians.

Plasmodium falciparum continues to develop resistance to currently available anti-malarial drugs, posing great problems for malaria elimination. This study evaluates the frequencies of asymptomatic infection and multidrug resistance-1 (mdr-1) gene mutations in parasite isolates, which form the basis for understanding persistently high incidence in South West, Nigeria. METHODS: A total of 535 individuals aged from 6 months were screened during the epidemiological survey evaluating asymptomatic transmission. Parasite prevalence was determined by histidine-rich protein II rapid detection kit (RDT) in healthy individuals. Plasmodium falciparum mdr-1 gene mutations were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by restriction enzyme digest and electrophoresis to determine polymorphism in parasite isolates. Sequencing was done to confirm polymorphism. Proportions were compared using Chi-square test at p value < 0.05. RESULTS: Malaria parasites were detected by RDT in 204 (38.1%) individuals. Asymptomatic infection was detected in 117 (57.3%) and symptomatic malaria confirmed in 87 individuals (42.6%). Overall, individuals with detectable malaria by RDT was significantly higher in individuals with symptoms, 87 of 197 (44.2%), than asymptomatic persons; 117 of 338 (34.6%), p = 0.02.

The NGPBT phytoplasma is a 'Candidatus Phytoplasma convolvuli'-related strain and represents a subgroup lineage, 16SrXII-O (the accession number of the reference strain is MW530522, Kazeem et al. 2021). The present communication reports that NGPBT phytoplasma can also infect tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and jute mallow (Corchorus olitorius). Since May 2020, tomato and jute mallow grwn in Ibadan have been observed to develop yellowing, little leaf, and stunting symptoms (Fig. 1). Because the symptomatic plants occurred in the region approximately 1 km adjacent to where the NGPBT disease was reported, and the symptoms of infected plants resembled those of phytoplasma infection, molecular diagnostic assays for phytoplasma detection were deployed. Total DNAs were extracted from symptomatic plants, including four tomato plants and three jute mallows, as well as from asymptomatic two tomato and two jute mallow plants. The DNA samples were subjected to semi-nested PCR using phytoplasma 16S rRNA gene-specific primers P1A and P7A, followed by P1A and 16S-SR (Lee et al. 2004). An amplicon of 1.5 kb was obtained from each of the symptomatic plants, while no amplicon resulted from DNA samples of asymptomatic plants or negative controls without DNA templates (water and PCR reagents only). PCR products were cloned into the TOPO TA cloning vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and three clones were chosen for each sample for Sanger sequencing (Psomagen Inc., Rockville, MD, USA). The nearly full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences (1.53kb) derived from tomato (OP123558) and jute mallow (OP123559) samples were identical. Based on the iPhyClassifier phytoplasma classification web tool (Zhao et al. 2009) and the BLAST search against the NCBI nucleotide database, these phytoplasma strains showed 100% sequence identity in 16S rRNA gene with the NGPBT phytoplasma (16SrXII-O, MW530522). Moreover, two additional genetic loci including ribosomal protein genes rplV-rpsC, and rplO-secY-adk were also amplified by nested PCR or semi-nested PCR with specific primers rpStolF/rpStolR followed by rpStolF2/rpStolR (Martini et al. 2007), and SecYF1a (Xll)/MapR-703-a, followed by SecYF2a (Xll)/MapR-703-a (Lee et al. 2010). Gene fragments of rplV-rpsC (1238bp) and rplO-secY-adk (2064bp) were amplified from DNAs of diseased papaya, tomato, and jute mallow plants. The obtained sequences were deposited into GenBank, respectively: rplV-rpsC (OP123560, OP123562, and OP123563) and rplO-secY-adk (OP123565, OP123567, and OP123568). Multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) indicated that the sequences of phytoplasmas amplified from three different plant hosts were also identical in rp, secY, and adk genes. The MLSA results demonstrate that tomato and jute mallow are two new hosts of NGPBT phytoplasmas. This also marks the first time that phytoplasma diseases are associated with tomato and jute mallow in Nigeria, as prior to this study, phytoplasma diseases were only reported in coconut palm and papaya in the country (Osagie et al. 2016; Kazeem et al. 2021). Results from the present study suggest that insect vector(s) for the transmission of the NGPBT phytoplasma are present in the region. Since both tomato and jute mallow are important vegetable crops in Nigeria, timely dissemination of emerging disease information is needed to alert growers and extension personnel in the region. In addition, ongoing incidence, and prevalence surveys of NGPBT disease indicate that more infected papaya and tomato plants have been observed in the region than in previous years. A better understanding of the NGPBT phytoplasma disease epidemiology will help devise strategies to control the diseases associated with the NGPBT phytoplasma.","Tomato and Jute Mallow are Two New Hosts of Papaya Bunchy Top Phytoplasma, a 16SrXII-O Subgroup Strain in Nigeria.",NA,NA,"Inaba J and Kazeem SA and Zhao Y and Zwolińska A and Ogunfunmilayo AO and Arogundade O and Wei W"

A comprehensive evaluation of the epidemiology of this phenomenon will assist towards the global effort of reducing its burden. So, this systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the epidemiology of MDR K. pneumoniae in South-Eastern Asia (SEA). The study was done under the PRISMA guidelines and was preceded by the development of a priori protocol. The protocol was then registered in PROSPERO-the public registry for systematic reviews. Seven important outcomes which include the assessment of the overall MDR K. pneumoniae prevalence were designed to be evaluated. A literature search was carried out in five selected electronic databases and 4389 were screened. Of these articles, 21 studies that met the eligibility criteria were included in the review. Relevant data were extracted from the included studies. By conducting a quality effect meta-analysis, the pooled prevalence for MDR and ESBL K. pneumoniae in SEA was estimated at 55% (CI 9-96) and 27% (CI 32-100) respectively. The review also identified ESBL genes types of allodemic situations occurring mostly in respiratory tract infections. The high prevalence of MDR and ESBL K. pneumoniae in this subregion is highly significant and of both public health and clinical relevance.

A replication cohort of 356 Nigerian breast cancer patients was genotyped for 12 recurrent BRCA1/2 mutant alleles (Y101X, 1742insG, 4241delTG, M1775R, 4359insC, C64Y, 1623delTTAAA, Q1090X, and 943ins10 from BRCA1, and 1538delAAGA, 2630del11, and 9045delGAAA from BRCA2) by means of SNaPshot followed by direct sequencing or by direct sequencing alone. In addition, 260 African Americans and 118 Barbadians were genotyped for six of the recurrent BRCA1 mutations by SNaPshot assay. Of all the BRCA1/2 recurrent mutations we identified in the first cohort, six were identified in 11 patients in the replication study. These mutation carriers constitute 3.1 % [95 % Confidence Interval (CI) 1.6-5.5 %] of the replication cohort. By comparison, 6.9 % (95 % CI 4.7-9.7 %) of the discovery cohort carried BRCA1/2 recurrent mutations. For the subset of recurrent mutations we tested in breast cancer cases from Barbados or the United States, only two 943ins10 carriers were identified in African Americans. Nigerian breast cancer patients from Ibadan carry a broad and unique spectrum of BRCA1/2 mutations. Our data suggest that BRCA1/2 mutation testing limited to recurrent mutations is not sufficient to understand the BRCA1/2-associated breast cancer risk in African populations in the diaspora. As the cost of Sanger sequencing is considerably reduced, deploying innovative technologies such as high throughput DNA sequencing of BRCA1/2 and other cancer susceptibility genes will be essential for identifying high-risk individuals and families to reduce the burden of aggressive early onset breast cancer in low-resource settings.","Recurrent BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in breast cancer patients of African ancestry.","134","889-94","Zhang J and Fackenthal JD and Zheng Y and Huo D and Hou N and Niu Q and Zvosec C and Ogundiran TO and Hennis AJ and Leske MC and Nemesure B and Wu SY and Olopade OI"

Regular surveillance is necessary to make a definite conclusion on the emergence and pattern of possible resistance to ART. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was carried out in the Southwestern and Southeastern geopolitical zones of Nigeria. A total of 150, 217, and 475 participants were enrolled for the study in the Southwest (2004_Group A), Southwest (2015_Group B), and southeast (2015_Group C), respectively. Blood samples were collected from the study participants for DNA extraction and a nested PCR for P. falciparum identification. Samples that were positive for P. falciparum were genotyped for the pfk13 gene using the Sanger sequencing method. The single nucleotide polymorphisms were analysed using the Bioedit software. RESULTS: A total of 116, 125, and 83 samples were positive for P. falciparum, respectively for the samples collected from the Southwest (2004 and 2015) and southeast (2015). Parasite DNA samples collected from febrile children in 2004 (Group A; n = 71) and 2015 (Group B; n = 73) in Osogbo Western Nigeria and 2015_Group C (n = 36) in southeast Nigeria were sequenced successfully. This study did not observe mutations associated with the in vitro resistance in southeast Asia, such as Y493H, R539T, I543T, and C580Y. Two new polymorphisms V520A and V581I were observed in two samples collected in Osogbo, Southwest Nigeria. These two mutations occurred in the year 2004 (Group A) before the introduction of ACT. Six mutations were identified in 17% of the samples collected in southeast Nigeria. One of these mutations (D547G) was non-synonymous, while the remaining (V510V, R515R, Q613Q, E688E, and N458N) were synonymous. Also, one (2%) heterozygote allele was identified at codon 458 in the 2015 (Group C) samples. CONCLUSIONS: None of the mutations observed in this study were previously validated to be associated with ART resistance. These results, therefore, suggest that artemisinin is likely to remain highly effective in treating malaria in the study areas that are malarious zone.","Absence of Plasmodium falciparum artemisinin resistance gene mutations eleven years after the adoption of artemisinin-based combination therapy in Nigeria.","20","434","Ikegbunam M and Ojo JA and Kokou K and Morikwe U and Nworu C and Uba C and Esimone C and Velavan TP and Ojurongbe O"

Blood samples were collected on filter paper in 2004 and 2015 from febrile children from ages 1-12 years. The R2 region of the GLURP gene was genotyped using nested polymerase chain reaction and by nucleotide sequencing. In all, 12 GLURP alleles were observed in a total of 199 samples collected in the two study years. The multiplicity of infection (MOI) marginally increased over the two study years; however, the differences were statistically insignificant (2004 samples MOI = 1.23 versus 2015 samples MOI = 1.47). Some alleles were stable in their prevalence, whereas two GLURP alleles, VIII and XI, showed considerable variability between both years. This variability was replicated when GLURP sequences from other regions were compared with ours. The expected heterozygosity (He) values (He = 0.87) were identical for the two groups. High variability in the rearrangement of the amino acid repeat units in the R2 region were observed, with the amino acid repeat sequence DKNEKGQHEIVEVEEILPE more prevalent in both years, compared with the two other repeat sequences observed in the study.

The antimicrobial resistance profile and the Extended-Spectrum and Metallo β-lactamases production were carried out using standard microbiological techniques. PCR, DNA sequencing analyses, and Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism were used to characterize the integrons and their associated GCs. Furthermore, the genotypic relationships between the different isolated K. pneumoniae were determined using Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus (ERIC)-PCR. About 98% (51/52) of the confirmed isolates harboured an integrase gene, with 80% intI1, while the remaining 20% concurrently harboured intI1 and intI2, with no intI3 observed. About 78% (40/51) of the bacterial strains were positive for a promoter, the P2R2, investigated, while 80% (41/51) harboured at least one of the qacEΔ1 and sul1.

Following evidence of associations between the mosquito microbiota and insecticide resistance, the microbiota of Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto (s.s.) from Tulukuyi village, Bungoma, Kenya, with differing permethrin resistance profiles were comparatively characterized. METHODS: Using the CDC bottle bioassay, 133 2-3 day-old, virgin, non-blood fed female F(1) progeny of field-caught An. gambiae s.s. were exposed to five times (107.5 µg/ml) the discriminating dose of permethrin. Post bioassay, 50 resistant and 50 susceptible mosquitoes were subsequently screened for kdr East and West mutations, and individually processed for microbial analysis using high throughput sequencing targeting the universal bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA gene. RESULTS: 47 % of the samples tested (n = 133) were resistant, and of the 100 selected for further processing, 99 % were positive for kdr East and 1 % for kdr West. Overall, 84 bacterial taxa were detected across all mosquito samples, with 36 of these shared between resistant and susceptible mosquitoes. A total of 20 bacterial taxa were unique to the resistant mosquitoes and 28 were unique to the susceptible mosquitoes. There were significant differences in bacterial composition between resistant and susceptible individuals (PERMANOVA, pseudo-F = 2.33, P = 0.001), with presence of Sphingobacterium, Lysinibacillus and Streptococcus (all known pyrethroid-degrading taxa), and the radiotolerant Rubrobacter, being significantly associated with resistant mosquitoes. On the other hand, the presence of Myxococcus, was significantly associated with susceptible mosquitoes. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of distinct microbiota in An. gambiae s.s. associated with intense pyrethroid resistance. The findings highlight differentially abundant bacterial taxa between resistant and susceptible mosquitoes, and further suggest a microbe-mediated mechanism of insecticide resistance in mosquitoes. These results also indicate fixation of the kdr East mutation in this mosquito population, precluding further analysis of its associations with the mosquito microbiota, but presenting the hypothesis that any microbe-mediated mechanism of insecticide resistance would be likely of a metabolic nature. Overall, this study lays initial groundwork for understanding microbe-mediated mechanisms of insecticide resistance in African mosquito vectors of malaria, and potentially identifying novel microbial markers of insecticide resistance that could supplement existing vector surveillance tools.","Western Kenyan Anopheles gambiae showing intense permethrin resistance harbour distinct microbiota.","20","77","Omoke D and Kipsum M and Otieno S and Esalimba E and Sheth M and Lenhart A and Njeru EM and Ochomo E and Dada N"

We then designed a PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay using XmiI (AccI) and RsaI (AfaI) restriction enzymes to differentiate members of both haplogroups. This result provides more molecular evidence supporting the existence of distinct mitochondrial variants of T. hydatigena. The epidemiological significance of these different mitochondrial groups remains to be explored further. The current PCR-RFLP assay offers a useful molecular approach for investigating the genetic population structure of T. hydatigena in enzootic regions and in identifying/discriminating the different mitochondrial groups (haplogroups A and B).","PCR-RFLP assay confirms the existence of different mitochondrial lineages of Taenia hydatigena including a possible geographically restricted group.","69","2390-2397","Ohiolei JA and Yan HB and Li L and Alvi MA and Muku RJ and Wu YD and Zhang NZ and Li WH and Guo AM and Wang XL and Fu BQ and Jia WZ"

We characterized three of these polymorphisms (rs12255372, rs7903146 and the microsatellite DG10S478) in an admixed sample of 286 patients with T2D and 275 controls from Mexico City. We also analyzed three samples representative of the relevant parental populations: Native Americans from the state of Guerrero (Mexico), Spanish from Valencia and Nigerians (Bini from the Edo region). In order to minimize potential confounding because of the presence of population stratification in the sample, we evaluated the association of the three TCF7L2 polymorphisms with T2D by using the program admixmap to fit a logistic regression model incorporating individual ancestry, sex, age, body mass index and education. The markers rs12255372, rs7903146 and DG10S478 are in tight disequilibrium in the Mexican sample. We observed a significant association between the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs12255372 and the microsatellite DG10S478 with T2D in the Mexican sample [rs12255372, odds ratio (OR) = 1.78, p = 0.017; DG10S478, OR = 1.62, p = 0.041]. The SNP rs7903146 shows similar trends, but its association with T2D is not as strong (OR = 1.39, p = 0.152).

In sub-Saharan West African (WA) Blacks, some nonancestral alleles of iron-related genes HJV, SLC40A1, and TFR2 are common, whereas in European Americans (EA) the same alleles are rare. These alleles have not been used to estimate WA Black ancestry in AA. Methods: We estimated WA Black ancestry in AA (M) using published HJV c.929C>G (rs7540883), SLC40A1 c.744G>T (rs11568350), and TFR2 c.713C>T (rs34242818) allele frequencies in WA Blacks, AA, and EA. We computed standard error (SE) and one-sided 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each M. Results: The combined representation of WA Blacks from The Gambia and Nigeria was 79-89%. Aggregate HJV, SLC40A1, and TFR2 allele frequencies in WA Blacks were 0.1025 [95% CI: 0.0835-0.1253] (n = 405), 0.0517 [0.0469-0.0569] (n = 3839), and 0.1432 [0.1202-0.1697] (n = 405), respectively.

However, the application of these antimalarials has two extremes, limited access to drug and drug pressure, which may have similar impact on malaria control, leading to treatment failure through divergent mechanisms. Limited access to drugs ensures that patients do not get the right doses of the antimalarials in order to have an effective plasma concentration to kill the malaria parasites, which leads to treatment failure and overall reduction in malaria control via increased transmission rate. On the other hand, drug pressure can lead to the selection of drug resistance phenotypes in a subpopulation of the malaria parasites as they mutate in order to adapt. This also leads to a reduction in malaria control. Addressing these extremes in antimalarial application can be essential in maintaining the relevance of the conventional antimalarials in winning the war against malaria.","Impact of Drug Pressure versus Limited Access to Drug in Malaria Control: The Dilemma.","9",NA,"Egwu CO and Obasi NA and Aloke C and Nwafor J and Tsamesidis I and Chukwu J and Elom S"

"181","Aaron_1","NO","BMC cancer","BACKGROUND: Leptin, a 16 kDa polypeptide hormone, implicated in various physiological processes, exerts its action through the leptin receptor, a member of the class I cytokine receptor family. Both leptin and leptin receptor have recently been implicated in processes leading to breast cancer initiation and progression in animal models and humans. An A to G transition mutation in codon 223 in exon 6 of the leptin receptor gene, resulting in glutamine to arginine substitution (Gln223Arg), lies within the first of two putative leptin-binding regions and may be associated with impaired signaling capacity of the leptin receptor. This study was designed to assess the role of this polymorphism in breast cancer susceptibility in Nigerian women. METHODS: We utilized a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay to evaluate the association between the Gln223Arg polymorphism of the leptin receptor gene and breast risk in Nigeria in a case control study involving 209 women with breast cancer and 209 controls without the disease. Study participants were recruited from surgical outpatient clinics and surgical wards of four University Teaching Hospitals located in Midwestern and southeastern Nigeria between September 2002 and April 2004. RESULTS: Premenopausal women carrying at least one LEPR 223Arg allele were at a modestly increased risk of breast cancer after adjusting for confounders (OR = 1.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0-3.2, p = 0.07). There was no association with postmenopausal breast cancer risk (OR = 0.9, 95% CI 0.4-1.8, p = 0.68).

Larvae collected in Port-Harcourt, were reared to adulthood and used for WHO bioassays. The population exhibited high resistance to permethrin, deltamethrin and DDT with mortalities of 6.7% ± 2.4, 37.5% ± 3.2 and 6.3% ± 4.1, respectively, but were fully susceptible to bendiocarb and malathion.

Transcriptional profiling revealed five major resistance-associated genes overexpressed in the field samples compared to the fully susceptible laboratory colony, Ngoussou. Highest fold change (FC) was observed with GSTe2 (FC = 3.3 in permethrin exposed and 6.2 in unexposed) and CYP6Z3 (FC = 1.4 in exposed and 4.6 in unexposed).

Genome analysis of multi-drug resistant and potentially pathogenic Escherichia coli isolates (members of the widely distributed ST10 complex) revealed the presence of the extended spectrum beta-lactamase gene blaCTX-M-15 on self-transmissible IncF plasmids.

All strains were isolated from a wetland for which previous qPCR enumeration of marker genes, in particular the ratio of intI1 to 16S rRNA gene copy numbers, had indicated a strong anthropogenic impact. Consistent with the isolation origin, qPCR analysis in this study showed that the blaCTX-M gene was present at an abundance of 1x10-4 relative to bacterial 16S rRNA gene copy numbers.

They pose a serious global health threat and have become a challenge for health care providers. The aim of this research was to assess the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Escherichia coli in University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital Ituku-Ozalla Enugu and to detect the risk factors for acquisition of the resistant organism. To proffer advice on antibiotic stewardship in clinical practice and public health interventions, to curb the spread of the resistant organisms in the hospital. RESULTS: Out of the 200 E. coli isolates, 70 (35.00%) were confirmed positive for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production. Fifty-three (75.7%) were from hospital acquired infections. All the isolates were resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol while 68 (97.14%) of the 70 isolates were susceptible to imipenem. Bla(TEM), bla(SHV) and bla(TEM) were detected in 66 (94%) of the 70 isolates.

We evaluated the contribution of an inherited predisposition to breast cancer in this population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cases were 1,136 women with invasive breast cancer (mean age at diagnosis, 47.5 ± 11.5 years) ascertained in Ibadan, Nigeria. Patients were selected regardless of age at diagnosis, family history, or prior genetic testing. Controls were 997 women without cancer (mean age at interview, 47.0 ± 12.4 years) from the same communities. BROCA panel sequencing was used to identify loss-of-function mutations in known and candidate breast cancer genes. RESULTS: Of 577 patients with information on tumor stage, 86.1% (497) were diagnosed at stage III (241) or IV (256). Of 290 patients with information on tumor hormone receptor status and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, 45.9% (133) had triple-negative breast cancer. Among all cases, 14.7% (167 of 1,136) carried a loss-of-function mutation in a breast cancer gene: 7.0% in BRCA1, 4.1% in BRCA2, 1.0% in PALB2, 0.4% in TP53, and 2.1% in any of 10 other genes. Odds ratios were 23.4 (95% CI, 7.4 to 73.9) for BRCA1 and 10.3 (95% CI, 3.7 to 28.5) for BRCA2. Risks were also significantly associated with PALB2 (11 cases, zero controls; P = .002) and TP53 (five cases, zero controls; P = .036). Compared with other patients, BRCA1 mutation carriers were younger ( P < .001) and more likely to have triple-negative breast cancer ( P = .028).

Our results suggest that the deletion event probably occurred in the human lineage on a chromosome with a CAG allele length at the upper end of the normal size range, as the deletion seemed to be only associated with human chromosomes with 20 or more repeats. These deletion chromosomes are prone to expansion into the HD range because they are at the upper end of the normal range. These data explain the apparent 'founder' HD haplotype defined by the deletion and suggest that chromosomes carrying the deletion are no more mutable than non-deletion chromosomes with similar sized CAG repeats.","Haplotype analysis of the delta 2642 and (CAG)n polymorphisms in the Huntington's disease (HD) gene provides an explanation for an apparent 'founder' HD haplotype.","4","203-6","Rubinsztein DC and Leggo J and Goodburn S and Barton DE and Ferguson-Smith MA"

To facilitate pre-elimination efforts in this region, two populations of Anopheles coluzzii from Central Chad Republic were characterized, their insecticide resistance profile and the possible molecular mechanisms driving the resistance in the field investigated. METHODS: Bloodfed female Anopheles gambiae s.l. resting indoor, were collected at N'djamena and Massakory, Chad in 2018 and characterized for species composition, and infection rate was determined using the TaqMan assay. Susceptibility to various insecticides was assessed using WHO tube bioassays. Cone bioassays were conducted using various long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs). Results were analysed using Chi Square test. Knockdown resistance (kdr) and ace-1 markers were investigated by TaqMan genotyping. RESULTS: Anopheles coluzzii was the major vector found in N'djamena (100%) and Massakory (~ 94%). No Plasmodium was found in 147 bloodfed F(0) An. coluzzii (82 from N'djamena and 65 from Massakory). High intensity pyrethroid resistance was observed with mortalities of < 2% for permethrin, deltamethrin and etofenprox, and with < 50% and < 60% dead following exposure to 10× diagnostic doses of deltamethrin and permethrin, respectively. For both sites, < 10% mortalities were observed with DDT. Synergist bioassays with piperonylbutoxide significantly recovered pyrethroid susceptibility in Massakory populations, implicating CYP450s (mortality = 13.6% for permethrin, χ(2) = 22.8, df = 1, P = 0.0006; mortality = 13.0% for deltamethrin, χ(2) = 8.8, df = 1, P < 0.00031). Cone-bioassays established complete loss of efficacy of the pyrethroid-based LLINs; and a 100% recovery of susceptibility following exposure to the roof of PermaNet®3.0, containing piperonylbutoxide. Both populations were susceptible to malathion, but high bendiocarb resistance was observed in Massakory population. The absence of ace-1 mutation points to the role of metabolic resistance in the bendiocarb resistance. Both 1014F and 1014S mutations were found in both populations at around 60% and < 20% respectively.

METHODOLOGY: Plasmid extraction of 54 clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa was carried out by alkaline lysis method; and plasmid size estimation was done by using E. coli V517 standard plasmid marker. Fifty-four clinical strains of P. aeruginosa were isolated from 5 hospitals in 3 Southwestern states of Nigeria between March and September 2010. Plasmid extraction of isolates was carried out by alkaline lysis method; and plasmid size estimation was done by using E. coli V517 standard plasmid marker. PCR amplification for the 3 classes of resistance integrons, and gene cassette characterization were carried out using specific primers and by sequencing of PCR products. Conjugal mating of the integron positive P. aeruginosa strains with E. coli DH5α was performed to demonstrate transferability of integrons and gene cassettes. RESULT: Agarose gel electrophoresis of plasmid DNA revealed that all the 54 P. aeruginosa harboured 1-4 plasmids with sizes ranging from 2.2 - >58 kb. Class 1 integron was identified in 31 (57%) strains; but none of them carried class 2 and class 3 integrons. High prevalence of aadA gene conferring resistance to streptomycin/spectinomycin was detected in the strains positive for class 1 integron. Sequencing of the 1.6 kb and 1.2 kb amplified band of gene cassettes revealed the presence of aadA6-orfD and aadA13 respectively. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the presence of plasmids and integrons harbouring resistance gene cassettes, which may collectively constitute an efficient system for dissemination of resistance genes in P. aeruginosa. Disturbingly, the rapid and unabated spread of class 1 integron-associated multidrug resistant P. aeruginosa in Southwest Nigeria may greatly hamper successful treatment of infections caused by such strains. This necessitates the establishment of functional antimicrobial resistance surveillance programmes in Nigeria.","Analysis of integrons and associated gene cassettes in clinical isolates of multidrug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa from Southwest Nigeria.","12","29","Odumosu BT and Adeniyi BA and Chandra R"

This makes identifying new insecticide targets or alternative vector control strategies necessary. CLassifier of Essentiality AcRoss EukaRyote (CLEARER), a leave-one-organism-out cross-validation machine learning classifier for essential genes, was used to predict essential genes in Anopheles gambiae and selected predicted genes experimentally validated. The CLEARER algorithm was trained on six model organisms: Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and employed to identify essential genes in An. gambiae. Of the 10,426 genes in An. gambiae, 1,946 genes (18.7%) were predicted to be Cellular Essential Genes (CEGs), 1716 (16.5%) to be Organism Essential Genes (OEGs), and 852 genes (8.2%) to be essential as both OEGs and CEGs. RNA interference (RNAi) was used to validate the top three highly expressed non-ribosomal predictions as probable vector control targets, by determining the effect of these genes on the survival of An. gambiae G3 mosquitoes. In addition, the effect of knockdown of arginase (AGAP008783) on Plasmodium berghei infection in mosquitoes was evaluated, an enzyme we computationally inferred earlier to be essential based on chokepoint analysis. Arginase and the top three genes, AGAP007406 (Elongation factor 1-alpha, Elf1), AGAP002076 (Heat shock 70kDa protein 1/8, HSP), AGAP009441 (Elongation factor 2, Elf2), had knockdown efficiencies of 91%, 75%, 63%, and 61%, respectively. While knockdown of HSP or Elf2 significantly reduced longevity of the mosquitoes (p<0.0001) compared to control groups, Elf1 or arginase knockdown had no effect on survival. However, arginase knockdown significantly reduced P. berghei oocytes counts in the midgut of mosquitoes when compared to LacZ-injected controls. The study reveals HSP and Elf2 as important contributors to mosquito survival and arginase as important for parasite development, hence placing them as possible targets for vector control.","Combination of computational techniques and RNAi reveal targets in Anopheles gambiae for malaria vector control.","19","e0305207","Adedeji EO and Beder T and Damiani C and Cappelli A and Accoti A and Tapanelli S and Ogunlana OO and Fatumo S and Favia G and Koenig R and Adebiyi E"

This study aimed to detect the virulence and antibiotic resistance genes of invasive Salmonella enterica from children with bacteremia in north-central Nigeria. METHOD: From June 2015 to June 2018, 4163 blood cultures yielded 83 Salmonella isolates. This is a secondary cross-sectional analysis of the Salmonella isolates. The Salmonella enterica were isolated and identified using standard bacteriology protocol. Biochemical identifications of the Salmonella enterica were made by Phoenix MD 50 identification system. Further identification and confirmation were done with polyvalent antisera O and invA gene. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done following clinical and laboratory standard institute guidelines. Resistant genes and virulence genes were determined using a real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULT: Salmonella typhi 51 (61.4%) was the most prevalent serovar, followed by Salmonella species 13 (15.7%), choleraesuis 8 (9.6%), enteritidis 6 (7.2%), and typhimurium 5 (6.1%). Fifty-one (61.4%) of 83 Salmonella enterica were typhoidal, while 32 (38.6%) were not. Sixty-five (78.3%) of the 83 Salmonella enterica isolates were resistant to ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, followed by chloramphenicol 39 (46.7%), tetracycline 41 (41.4%), piperacillin 33 (33.9%), amoxicillin-clavulanate, and streptomycin 21 (25.3%), while cephalothin was 19 (22.9%). Thirty-nine (46.9%) of the 83 Salmonella enterica isolates were multi-drug resistant, and none were extensive drug resistant or pan-drug resistant. A bla(TEM) 42 (50.6%), floR 32 (38.6%), qnrA 24 (28.9%), tetB 20 (20.1%), tetA 10 (10.0%), and tetG 5 (6.0%) were the antibiotic resistance genes detected. There were perfect agreement between phenotypic and genotypic detection of antimicrobial resistance in tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, and chloramphenicol, while beta-lactam showed κ = 0.60 agreement.

Yet, there are regions in Nigeria where cases of ESBL were under-reported. The review aims to assess the prevalence of ESBL-producing Gram-negative bacteria in Nigeria and the genes involved. METHODS: An extensive literature search was carried out through an electronic database including PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar and African Journals Online (AJOL). Articles published between January 2004 and November 2019 were included in the study. The titles and abstracts of the retrieved articles were reviewed, and then the full texts of the selected articles were reviewed. Articles were divided according to geopolitical zones. RESULTS: Among the 217 articles identified, 60 studies (10 from north-central, 4 from northeast, 7 from the northwest, 17 from the southeast, 10 from south-south, and 12 from southwest Nigeria) were included. The highest prevalence recorded was 82.3%, while the lowest was 7.5%. The genes TEM, SHV, and CTX-M were the predominant variant commonly found. The most frequently used phenotypic detection method is the double disc synergy test (DDST). CONCLUSION: ESBL-producing Gram-negative bacteria in hospital and community settings in Nigeria were commonly found. The prevalence of ESBL is very high, with one of the geopolitical zones under-reported. Future research should be conducted in these zones where there are scant studies, and a holistic approach involving the clinicians, researchers, laboratory scientists, and patients will go a long way in reducing the dissemination of this resistance mechanism.","A systematic review on the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta lactamase-producing Gram-negative bacteria in Nigeria.","22","488-496","Tanko N and Bolaji RO and Olayinka AT and Olayinka BO"

In 131 P. falciparum-infected children in rural Nigeria, the frequency of the resistant Asn108 genotype was assessed by enzymatic restriction digestion of polymerase chain reaction-amplified DHFR sequences and compared with residual pyrimethamine blood levels. The prevalence of the Asn108 variant was 41.2%. In 18.3% of the isolates, both the Asn108 and the wild-type alleles were present. In contrast to the high prevalence of resistant genotypes, residual pyrimethamine blood levels were detected in only 4%. Furthermore, age was found to be a determinant of the parasite genotype since the proportion of Asn108 variants decreased with age (P < 0.05).

Here, we evaluated the patterns of ESBL resistance in children enrolled into a surveillance study for community acquired bacteremic syndromes across health facilities in Central and Northwestern Nigeria. METHOD: Blood culture was performed for children aged less than 5 years suspected of having sepsis from Sept 2008-Dec 2016. Blood was incubated using the BACTEC00AE system and Enterobacteriacea identified to the species level using Analytical Profile Index (API20E®). Antibiotic susceptibility profile was determined by the disc diffusion method. Real time PCR was used to characterize genes responsible for ESBL production. RESULT: Of 21,000 children screened from Sept 2008-Dec 2016, 2,625(12.5%) were culture-positive. A total of 413 Enterobacteriaceae available for analysis were screened for ESBL. ESBL production was detected in 160 Enterobacteriaceae, high resistance rates were observed among ESBL-positive isolates for Ceftriaxone (92.3%), Aztreonam (96.8%), Cefpodoxime (96.3%), Cefotaxime (98.8%) and Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (90%), while 87.5%, 90.7%, and 91.9% of the isolates were susceptible to Imipenem, Amikacin and Meropenem respectively. Frequently detected resistance genes were blaTEM-83.8% (134/160), and, blaCTX-M 83.1% (133/160) followed by blaSHVgenes 66.3% (106/160). Co-existence of blaCTX-M, blaTEM and blaSHV was seen in 94/160 (58.8%), blaCTX-M and blaTEM in 118/160 (73.8%), blaTEM and blaSHV in 97/160 (60.6%) and blaCTX-M and blaSHV in 100/160 (62.5%) of isolates tested. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate a high prevalence of bacteremia from ESBL Enterobacteriaceae in this population of children.

However, the full catalogue of clinically relevant pharmacogenetic variants in these genes is yet to be established, especially across African populations. This study therefore aimed to characterize the star allele (haplotype) distribution in CYP2B6 and CYP2A6 across diverse and understudied sub-Saharan African (SSA) populations. We called star alleles from 961 high-depth full genomes using StellarPGx, Aldy, and PyPGx. In addition, we performed CYP2B6 and CYP2A6 star allele frequency comparisons between SSA and other global biogeographical groups represented in the new 1000 Genomes Project high-coverage dataset (n = 2,000). This study presents frequency information for star alleles in CYP2B6 (e.g., *6 and *18; frequency of 21-47% and 2-19%, respectively) and CYP2A6 (e.g., *4, *9, and *17; frequency of 0-6%, 3-10%, and 6-20%, respectively), and predicted phenotypes (for CYP2B6), across various African populations. In addition, 50 potentially novel African-ancestry star alleles were computationally predicted by StellarPGx in CYP2B6 and CYP2A6 combined. For each of these genes, over 4% of the study participants had predicted novel star alleles. Three novel star alleles in CYP2A6 (*54, *55, and *56) and CYP2B6 apiece, and several suballeles were further validated via targeted Single-Molecule Real-Time resequencing. Our findings are important for informing the design of comprehensive pharmacogenetic testing platforms, and are highly relevant for personalized medicine strategies, especially relating to antiretroviral medication and smoking cessation treatment in Africa and the African diaspora.

We screened 693 European and African shrews for hepatitis B virus (HBV) homologs to elucidate the enigmatic genealogy of HBV. Shrews host HBVs at low prevalence (2.5%) across a broad geographic and host range. The phylogenetically divergent shrew HBVs comprise separate species termed crowned shrew HBV (CSHBV) and musk shrew HBV (MSHBV), each containing distinct genotypes. Recombination events across host orders, evolutionary reconstructions, and antigenic divergence of shrew HBVs corroborated ancient origins of mammalian HBVs dating back about 80 million years. Resurrected CSHBV replicated in human hepatoma cells, but human- and tupaia-derived primary hepatocytes were resistant to hepatitis D viruses pseudotyped with CSHBV surface proteins. Functional characterization of the shrew sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (Ntcp), CSHBV/MSHBV surface peptide binding patterns, and infection experiments revealed lack of Ntcp-mediated entry of shrew HBV. Contrastingly, HBV entry was enabled by the shrew Ntcp. Shrew HBVs universally showed mutations in their genomic preCore domains impeding hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) production and resembling those observed in HBeAg-negative human HBV. Deep sequencing and in situ hybridization suggest that HBeAg-negative shrew HBVs cause intense hepatotropic monoinfections and low within-host genomic heterogeneity. Geographical clustering and low MSHBV/CSHBV-specific seroprevalence suggest focal transmission and high virulence of shrew HBVs. HBeAg negativity is thus an ancient HBV infection pattern, whereas Ntcp usage for entry is not evolutionarily conserved. Shrew infection models relying on CSHBV/MSHBV revertants and human HBV will allow comparative assessments of HBeAg-mediated HBV pathogenesis, entry, and species barriers.","Highly diversified shrew hepatitis B viruses corroborate ancient origins and divergent infection patterns of mammalian hepadnaviruses.","116","17007-17012","Rasche A and Lehmann F and König A and Goldmann N and Corman VM and Moreira-Soto A and Geipel A and van Riel D and Vakulenko YA and Sander AL and Niekamp H and Kepper R and Schlegel M and Akoua-Koffi C and Souza BFCD and Sahr F and Olayemi A and Schulze V and Petraityte-Burneikiene R and Kazaks A and Lowjaga KAAT and Geyer J and Kuiken T and Drosten C and Lukashev AN and Fichet-Calvet E and Ulrich RG and Glebe D and Drexler JF"

Extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) and carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae isolates are a public health concern. This study investigated the existence of some ESBL and carbapenemase genes among clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae in Southwest Nigeria and additionally determined their circulating clones. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Various clinical samples from 420 patients from seven tertiary hospitals within Southwestern Nigeria were processed between February 2018 and July 2019. These samples were cultured on blood agar and MacConkey agar, and the isolated bacteria were identified by Microbact GNB 12E. All K. pneumoniae were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the 16s rRNA gene. Antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) was done on these isolates, and the PCR was used to evaluate the common ESBL-encoding genes and carbapenem resistance genes. Genotyping was performed using multi-locus sequencing typing (MLST). RESULTS: The overall prevalence of K. pneumoniae in Southwestern Nigeria was 30.5%. The AST revealed high resistance rates to tetracyclines (67.2%), oxacillin (61.7%), ampicillin (60.2%), ciprofloxacin (58.6%), chloramphenicol (56.3%), and lowest resistance to meropenem (43.0%). All isolates were susceptible to polymyxin B. The most prevalent ESBL gene was the TEM gene (47.7%), followed by CTX-M (43.8%), SHV (39.8%), OXA (27.3%), CTX-M-15 (19.5%), CTX-M-2 (11.1%), and CTX-M-9 (10.9%). Among the carbapenemase genes studied, the VIM gene (43.0%) was most detected, followed by OXA-48 (28.9%), IMP (22.7%), NDM (17.2%), KPC (13.3%), CMY (11.7%), and FOX (9.4%). GIM and SPM genes were not detected. MLST identified six different sequence types (STs) in this study. The most dominant ST was ST307 (50%, 5/10), while ST258, ST11, ST147, ST15, and ST321 had (10%, 1/10) each. CONCLUSION: High antimicrobial resistance in K. pneumoniae is a clear and present danger for managing infections in Nigeria.

The active surveillance of ARB using an integrated one-health approach can help to reduce the emergence and spread of ARB, reduce the associated economic impact, and guide antimicrobial stewardship programs. Wastewater surveillance (WWS) of ARB provides composite samples for a total population, with easy access to the mixed community microbiome. This concept is emerging rapidly, but the clinical utility, sensitivity, and uniformity of WWS of ARB remain poorly understood especially in relation to clinical evidence in sewershed communities. Here, we systematically searched the literature to identify studies that have compared findings from WWS of ARB and antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) with clinical evidence in parallel, thereby evaluating how likely WWS of ARB and ARG can relate to the clinical cases in communities. Initially, 2,235 articles were obtained using the primary search keywords, and 1,219 articles remained after de-duplication. Among these, 35 articles fulfilled the search criteria, and an additional 13 relevant articles were included by searching references in the primary literature. Among the 48 included papers, 34 studies used a culture-based method, followed by 11 metagenomics, and three PCR-based methods. A total of 28 out of 48 included studies were conducted at the single sewershed level, eight studies involved several countries, seven studies were conducted at national or regional scales, and five at hospital levels. Our review revealed that the performance of WWS of ARB pathogens has been evaluated more frequently for Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., and other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, but has not been uniformly tested for all ARB pathogens. Many wastewater-based ARB studies comparing the findings with clinical evidence were conducted to evaluate the public health risk but not to relate with clinical evidence and to evaluate the performance of WWS of ARB. Indeed, relating WWS of ARB with clinical evidence in a sewershed is not straightforward, as the source of ARB in wastewater cannot be only from symptomatic human individuals but can also be from asymptomatic carriers as well as from animal sources. Further, the varying fates of each bacterial species and ARG within the sewerage make the aim of connecting WWS of ARB with clinical evidence more complicated. Therefore, future studies evaluating the performance of many AMR pathogens and their genes for WWS one by one can make the process simpler and the interpretation of results easier.","Wastewater surveillance of antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens: A systematic review.","13","977106","Tiwari A and Kurittu P and Al-Mustapha AI and Heljanko V and Johansson V and Thakali O and Mishra SK and Lehto KM and Lipponen A and Oikarinen S and Pitkänen T and Heikinheimo A"

ABO hemolytic disease of the newborn is the most common hemolytic consequence of maternofetal blood group incompatibility restricted mostly to non-group-O babies of group O mothers with immune anti-A or anti-B antibodies. Aim. We estimated the risk of ABO HDN with view to determining need for routine screening for ABO incompatibility between mother and fetus. Materials and Methods. Prevalence of ABO blood group phenotypes in blood donors at the donor clinic of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital and arithmetic methods were used to determine population prevalence of ABO genes. We then estimated proportion of pregnancies of group O mothers carrying a non-group-O baby and the risk that maternofetal ABO incompatibility will cause clinical ABO HDN. Results. Blood from 9138 donors was ABO typed. 54.3%, 23%, 19.4%, and 3.3% were blood groups O, A, B, and AB, respectively. Calculated gene frequencies were 0.1416, 0.1209, and 0.7375 for A, B, and O genes, respectively. It was estimated that 14.3% of deliveries will result in a blood group O woman giving birth to a child who is non-group-O. Approximately 4.3% of deliveries are likely to suffer ABO HDN with 2.7% prone to suffer from moderately severe to severe hemolysis.","Estimating the Risk of ABO Hemolytic Disease of the Newborn in Lagos.","2015","560738","Akanmu AS and Oyedeji OA and Adeyemo TA and Ogbenna AA"

In this study, the Bayesian evolutionary history and the spread of the virus through the different countries have been reported. METHODOLOGY: a database of 81 sequences of SalV structural VP1 fragment were downloaded from GenBank, aligned and manually edited by Bioedit Software. ModelTest v. 3.7 software was used to estimate the simplest evolutionary model fitting the sequence dataset. A Maximum-Likelihood tree has been generated using MEGA-X to test the ""clockliness"" signal using TempEst 1.5.1. The Bayesian phylogenetic tree was built by BEAST. Homology modelling was performed by SWISS-Model and protein variability evaluated by ConSurf server. RESULTS: the phylogenetic tree showed a clade of SalV A2 and three main clades of SalV A1, revealing several infections in humans in South Korea, India, Tunisia, China, Nigeria, Ethiopia and USA. The Bayesian maximum clade credibility tree and the time of the most common recent ancestor dated back the root of the tree to the year 1788 with the probable origin in USA. Selective pressure analysis revealed two positive selection sites, His at 100th and Leu at 116th positions that at the homology modelling resulted important to guarantee protein stability and variability. This could contribute to the development of new mutations modifying the clinical features of this evolving virus.

We enrolled 267 women who presented to our cervical cancer screening program in Abuja, Nigeria between April 2012 and August 2012. We collected information on demographic characteristics, risk factors of cervical cancer and obtained samples of blood and cervical exfoliated cells from all participants. We used Roche Linear Array HPV Genotyping Test® to characterize the prevalent HPV according to manufacturer's instruction; Sequenom Mass Array to test 21 SNPs in genes/regions previously associated with hrHPV and regression models to examine independent factors associated with HPV infection. We considered a p<0.05 as significant because this is a replication study. There were 65 women with and 202 women without hrHPV infection. Under the allelic model, we found significant association between two SNPs, rs2305809 on RPS19 and rs2342700 on TYMS, and prevalent hrHPV infection. Multivariate analysis of hrHPV risk adjusted for age, body mass index, smoking, age of menarche, age at sexual debut, lifetime total number of sexual partners and the total number of pregnancies as covariates, yielded a p-value of 0.071 and 0.010 for rs2305809 and rs2342700, respectively.

While the factors that determine the variations in clinical outcome of a malaria have not been completely defined, both host and parasite factors, as well as the complex molecular interactions between them have been implicated. The cyto-adherent properties of the P. falciparum-infected red blood cells are considered as key properties in the pathogenesis of malaria and the polymorphisms of the host adhesion molecules could contribute to the severity of malaria. Clinical information and blood samples were collected from 223 children from Ibadan (south-west Nigeria), median age of 34.5 months, presenting with different clinical manifestations of malaria--clinically asymptomatic parasitism (ACP), acute uncomplicated malaria (UM) and severe malaria (SM)--as defined by WHO criteria. The polymorphisms of genes coding for four human adhesion molecules at six different loci (ICAM-1 exons 2, 4 and 6, E-selectin exon 2, CD36 exon 10, and PECAM exon 3) were studied. DNA samples were prepared for further genotyping of the six exons mentioned above by PCR-RFLPs using the appropriate restriction digests for each loci. The ICAM-1 exon 4 locus was monomorphic. All the other loci were at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). The E-selectin locus had very low heterozygosity (approximately 0.06) in contrast to the other loci under study (0.23-0.44). Once the data was further processed for covariates (age and parasite density) and taking as the reference category the ACP group, results show that in the presence of the G allele at the ICAM-1 exon 6 there is an increased risk (3.6 times) of severe malaria. As far as the T allele in the E-selectin exon is concerned, the number of sampled DNAs with the T allele within both the UM and SM categories is too low for drawing any relevant conclusion at this stage. In conclusion, these results suggest that genetic polymorphisms at host adhesion molecules loci are an important variable in the susceptibility to severe malaria. Further studies of host loci are needed to further delineate which polymorphisms are associated with severe malaria and increase our knowledge of the biology of host-parasite interactions.","Plasmodium falciparum malaria in south-west Nigerian children: is the polymorphism of ICAM-1 and E-selectin genes contributing to the clinical severity of malaria?","95","248-55","Amodu OK and Gbadegesin RA and Ralph SA and Adeyemo AA and Brenchley PE and Ayoola OO and Orimadegun AE and Akinsola AK and Olumese PE and Omotade OO"

This association has not been tested in field populations. The aim of this study was to test the association between inversion 2La and dieldrin resistance in a field population of An. coluzzii in Nigeria. Field collected immature stages of Anopheles were raised to adults and exposed to 4% dieldrin according to WHO criteria. Knockdown was recorded at 10 min intervals for 1 hour and final mortality was recorded 24 hours post exposure. Species and inversion 2La diagnostic PCR assays were conducted on the resistant and susceptible mosquitoes. The mosquitoes were highly resistant to 4% dieldrin (17.1% knock down and 25.7% final mortality; KDT(50) and KDT(95) calculated as 170 and 1, 514 minutes respectively). Frequencies of 2La in both the resistant and susceptible cohorts assorted within HardyWeinberg estimates (χ(2)=1.32, p=0.8 for dead/susceptible mosquitoes and χ(2)=2.54, p=0.5 for survivors or resistant mosquitoes). However, a higher number of heterozygous mosquitoes were observed in the resistant cohort compared to the susceptible, with significant variation in karyotype frequencies (χ(2)=11.08, DF=2, p<0.05) and a significantly higher frequency of the 2La inversion arrangement in the resistant cohort (Pearson's χ(2) = 4.58, p = 0.03.). These data are the first to associate paracentric chromosome inversion 2La and dieldrin resistance in field population of An. coluzzii. Dieldrin resistance shows a weak but significant association with 2La whose assortment is affected by positive heterosis. Variation in the assortment of 2La inversion arrangements between resistant and susceptible cohorts of this An. coluzzii population suggests that dieldrin resistance is at least partially linked to inversion 2La which may explain the persistence of dieldrin resistance in this population despite a significant absence of selection for resistance to this insecticide.","Test for association between dieldrin resistance and 2La inversion polymorphism in Anopheles coluzzii from Lagos, Nigeria.","36","587-593","Adeogun AO and Brooke BD and Olayanju DR and Adegbehingbe K and Oyeniyi TA and Olakiigbe AK and Awolola TS"

METHODS: This was a retrospective review of histopathologically diagnosed thyroid carcinoma in children less than 18 years of age in the Department of Pathology, University College Hospital, Ibadan over a 40-year period. Histopathological diagnosis, age, sex and other relevant clinical information were extracted from the hospital records and surgical pathology records of the department. All cases of patients under18 years old had their slides re-examined and reclassified by two pathologists according to the World Health Organization histopathological classification of thyroid tumours. RESULTS: There were 25 cases of thyroid carcinomas seen in children within the study period. Papillary thyroid carcinoma was the most common, accounting for 80% of the cases. Follicular carcinoma accounted for 12%, and medullary and anaplastic carcinoma accounted for 4% each. The mean age at presentation was 13 years.

The disk diffusion method was used to assess the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of the isolates with the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) confirmed by the combined disk test screening method. Characterization of the resistance genes of the ESBL producers was carried out using polymerase chain reaction polymerase chain reaction technique. RESULTS: A. total of eight (six clinical and two nonclinical) A. baumannii isolates were identified. The overall isolate susceptibility and resistance rates to all the antimicrobial agents was 56.3% (27/48) and 35.4% (17/48), respectively. Similarly, all (8/8; 100.00%) isolates were susceptible to meropenem and 75.0% (6/8) to ampicillin-sulbactam while 62.5% (5/8) were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and 50.0% (4/8) to each of ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime.

After cultivation of samples on Hektoen Enteric agar and xylose lysine deoxycholate agar, standard microbiology tests, VITEK 2 system, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were utilized to identify Shigella isolates. The broth microdilution method was used to determine antibiotic susceptibility. PMQR genes including qnrA, qnrB, qnrC, qnrD, qnrE, qnrS, qnrVC, qepA, oqxAB, aac(6')-Ib-cr, and crpP and biofilm formation were investigated in quinolone-resistant isolates by PCR and microtiter plate method, respectively. An enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus polymerase chain reaction (ERIC-PCR) technique was used to determine the clonal relatedness of quinolone-resistant isolates. RESULTS: A total of 95 Shigella isolates including S. sonnei (53, 55.8%), S. flexneri (39, 41.1%), and S. boydii (3, 3.2%) were identified. The highest resistance rates of the isolates were against ampicillin (92.6%, n = 88/95). Overall, 42 of 95 (44.2%) isolates were simultaneously resistant against two or more quinolones including 26 (61.9%) S. sonnei and 16 (38.1%) S. flexneri. All isolates were multidrug-resistant (resistance to more than 3 antibiotics). The occurrence of PMQR genes was as follows: qnrS (52.4%), qnrA and aac(6')-Ib-cr (33.3%), and qnrB (19.0%). The prevalence in species was as follows: 61.5% and 37.5% (qnrS), 19.2% and 56.3% (qnrA), 38.5% and 25.0 (aac(6')-Ib-cr), and 19.2% and 18.8% (qnrB) for S. sonnei and S. flexneri, respectively. The other PMQR genes were not detected. In total, 52.8% (28/53) of quinolone-susceptible and 64.3% (27/42) of quinolone-resistant isolates were biofilm producers. Biofilm formation was not significantly different between quinolone-resistant and quinolone-susceptible isolates (P-value = 0.299). Quinolone-resistant isolates showed a high genetic diversity according to the ERIC-PCR. CONCLUSION: It seems that qnrS, qnrA, and aac(6')-Ib-cr play a significant role in the quinolone resistance among Shigella isolates in our region.

RESULTS: Minor allele frequencies for TGF-β1 (rs1800469, rs1800470, and rs1800471), APOL1 (rs60910145, rs73885319, and rs71785313), and HMOX1 (rs743811) were 0.25, 0.46, 0.46, 0.44, 0.45, 0.17, and 0.14, respectively. Among HIV-positive individuals, only TGF-β1 rs1800470 (GG vs AA), APOL1 (in the recessive model), and hypertension were associated with prevalent CKD (adjusted ORs of 0.44 [95% CI, 0.20-0.97], 2.54 [95% CI, 1.44-4.51], and 2.17 [95% CI, 1.35-3.48], respectively). No SNP polymorphisms were associated with prevalent CKD among HIV-negative individuals. LIMITATIONS: The lack of histopathology data for proper categorization of the type of HIV-related nephropathy. CONCLUSIONS: APOL1 polymorphisms were highly prevalent in this population and among adult patients infected with HIV and were associated with increased CKD risk. The TGF-β1 (rs1800470) polymorphism was associated with reduced risk, and HMOX1 polymorphisms were unassociated with CKD.","Association of Genetic Polymorphisms of TGF-β1, HMOX1, and APOL1 With CKD in Nigerian Patients With and Without HIV.","76","100-108","Ekrikpo UE and Mnika K and Effa EE and Ajayi SO and Okwuonu C and Waziri B and Bello A and Dandara C and Kengne AP and Wonkam A and Okpechi I"

CL/P is phenotypically heterogeneous and has a complex etiology caused by genetic and environmental factors. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified at least 15 risk loci for CL/P. As these loci do not account for all of the genetic variance of CL/P, we hypothesized the existence of additional risk loci. We conducted a multiethnic GWAS in 6480 participants (823 unrelated cases, 1700 unrelated controls and 1319 case-parent trios) with European, Asian, African and Central and South American ancestry. Our GWAS revealed novel associations on 2p24 near FAM49A, a gene of unknown function (P = 4.22 × 10(-8)), and 19q13 near RHPN2, a gene involved in organizing the actin cytoskeleton (P = 4.17 × 10(-8)). Other regions reaching genome-wide significance were 1p36 (PAX7), 1p22 (ARHGAP29), 1q32 (IRF6), 8q24 and 17p13 (NTN1), all reported in previous GWASs. Stratification by ancestry group revealed a novel association with a region on 17q23 (P = 2.92 × 10(-8)) among individuals with European ancestry. This region included several promising candidates including TANC2, an oncogene required for development, and DCAF7, a scaffolding protein required for craniofacial development. In the Central and South American ancestry group, significant associations with loci previously identified in Asian or European ancestry groups reflected their admixed ancestry. In summary, we have identified novel CL/P risk loci and suggest new genes involved in craniofacial development, confirming the highly heterogeneous etiology of OFCs.","A multi-ethnic genome-wide association study identifies novel loci for non-syndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate on 2p24.2, 17q23 and 19q13.","25","2862-2872","Leslie EJ and Carlson JC and Shaffer JR and Feingold E and Wehby G and Laurie CA and Jain D and Laurie CC and Doheny KF and McHenry T and Resick J and Sanchez C and Jacobs J and Emanuele B and Vieira AR and Neiswanger K and Lidral AC and Valencia-Ramirez LC and Lopez-Palacio AM and Valencia DR and Arcos-Burgos M and Czeizel AE and Field LL and Padilla CD and Cutiongco-de la Paz EM and Deleyiannis F and Christensen K and Munger RG and Lie RT and Wilcox A and Romitti PA and Castilla EE and Mereb JC and Poletta FA and Orioli IM and Carvalho FM and Hecht JT and Blanton SH and Buxó CJ and Butali A and Mossey PA and Adeyemo WL and James O and Braimah RO and Aregbesola BS and Eshete MA and Abate F and Koruyucu M and Seymen F and Ma L and de Salamanca JE and Weinberg SM and Moreno L and Murray JC and Marazita ML"
"240","Aaron_1","NO","G3 (Bethesda, Md.)","Pyrethroid resistance in malaria vector, An. funestus is increasingly reported across Africa, threatening the sustainability of pyrethroid-based control interventions, including long lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs). Managing this problem requires understanding of the molecular basis of the resistance from different regions of the continent, to establish whether it is being driven by a single or independent selective events. Here, using a genome-wide transcription profiling of pyrethroid resistant populations from southern (Malawi), East (Uganda), and West Africa (Benin), we investigated the molecular basis of resistance, revealing strong differences between the different African regions. The duplicated cytochrome P450 genes (CYP6P9a and CYP6P9b) which were highly overexpressed in southern Africa are not the most upregulated in other regions, where other genes are more overexpressed, including GSTe2 in West (Benin) and CYP9K1 in East (Uganda). The lack of directional selection on both CYP6P9a and CYP6P9b in Uganda in contrast to southern Africa further supports the limited role of these genes outside southern Africa. However, other genes such as the P450 CYP9J11 are commonly overexpressed in all countries across Africa. Here, CYP9J11 is functionally characterized and shown to confer resistance to pyrethroids and moderate cross-resistance to carbamates (bendiocarb). The consistent overexpression of GSTe2 in Benin is coupled with a role of allelic variation at this gene as GAL4-UAS transgenic expression in Drosophila flies showed that the resistant 119F allele is highly efficient in conferring both DDT and permethrin resistance than the L119. The heterogeneity in the molecular basis of resistance and cross-resistance to insecticides in An. funestus populations throughout sub-Saharan African should be taken into account in designing resistance management strategies.","Genome-Wide Transcription and Functional Analyses Reveal Heterogeneous Molecular Mechanisms Driving Pyrethroids Resistance in the Major Malaria Vector Anopheles funestus Across Africa.","7","1819-1832","Riveron JM and Ibrahim SS and Mulamba C and Djouaka R and Irving H and Wondji MJ and Ishak IH and Wondji CS"

In the present study, we demonstrated that GA promotes the growth of prostate cancer cells through induced protein expression of the cell cycle regulator. In addition, we also found that GA promoted the migratory ability of prostate cancer cells through induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated protein expression. In order to understand the potential prognostic relevance of GA-mediated regulators of the cell cycle and EMT, we present a three-gene signature to evaluate the prognosis of prostate cancer patients. Further investigations suggested that the three-gene signature (CDK4, TWIST1 and SNAI2) predicted the chances of survival better than any of the three genes alone for the first time. In conclusion, we suggested that the three-gene signature model can act as marker of GA exposure. Hence, this multi-gene panel may serve as a promising outcome predictor and potential therapeutic target in prostate cancer patients.","Glycidamide Promotes the Growth and Migratory Ability of Prostate Cancer Cells by Changing the Protein Expression of Cell Cycle Regulators and Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT)-Associated Proteins with Prognostic Relevance.","20",NA,"Ekanem TI and Huang CC and Wu MH and Lin DY and Lai WT and Lee KH"

We examined the clonal relationships among 103 clinical and environmental Vibrio cholerae isolates belonging to O1, O139, or non-O1 non-O139 serogroups isolated during epidemic and interepidemic periods in Bangladesh and compared them with those of 51 V. cholerae isolates from four countries in Asia and Africa. These studies were done by a computer-assisted numerical analysis of the restriction endonuclease cleavage patterns of rRNA genes (ribotypes). Unweighed pair-group cluster analysis of BglI- and HindIII-generated band patterns revealed 16 clusters. Ribotypes were defined as clusters of strains possessing > 98% similarity. The results showed that 154 isolates could be differentiated into 15 different ribotypes, and strains belonging to 3 of these ribotypes (ribotypes I, V, and VIIIA and VIIIB) were isolated more frequently during the epidemic periods than during interepidemic periods in Bangladesh. Classical vibrios belonged to six different ribotypes (ribotypes I to VI), with a mean similarity coefficient of 0.84, and the El Tor vibrios belonged to five different ribotypes (ribotypes VIIIA and IX to XII), with a mean similarity coefficient of 0.82. A single clone of El Tor vibrios (ribotype XII) was resident in Tanzania, whereas Nigeria, Syria, and India shared toxigenic El Tor strains with Bangladesh. Cholera toxin (CT)-positive O139 vibrios isolated from Bangladesh and India belonged to a single ribotype (ribotype VIIIB) and were > 98% similar to one of the ribotypes of El Tor vibrios (ribotype VIIIA), but a CT-negative O139 vibrio from Argentina (ribotype XIII) was < 75% similar to the same cluster of El Tor vibrios, thus suggesting more than one possible origin for O139 vibrios. Strains belonging to the same ribotypes (ribotypes VIII to X) were isolated from both patients and surface water in Bangladesh, indicating possible transmission through surface water. A clone of a CT-positive environmental isolate of non-O1 V. cholerae (ribotype VII) was found to be closely related (76.3% similarity) to a clone of classical vibrios (ribotype I) and was only between 27.2 and 56.1% similar to clusters of El Tor, O139, and two other non-O1 nontoxigenic clones.","Molecular epidemiology of toxigenic Vibrio cholerae in Bangladesh studied by numerical analysis of rRNA gene restriction patterns.","33","2833-8","Faruque SM and Roy SK and Alim AR and Siddique AK and Albert MJ"

METHODS: Three hundred and twenty children were enrolled into the study between 2005 and 2006. These included 140 children who presented with uncomplicated malaria at the Dalhatu Araf Specialist Hospital, Lafia and another 180 children from the study area with asymptomatic infection. DNA was extracted from blood spot on filter paper and MSP-2 genes were genotyped using allele-specific nested PCR in order to analyze the genetic diversity of parasite isolates. RESULTS: A total of 31 and 34 distinct MSP-2 alleles were identified in the asymptomatic and uncomplicated malaria groups respectively. No difference was found between the multiplicity of infection in the asymptomatic group and that of the uncomplicated malaria group (P>0.05). However, isolates of the FC27 allele type were dominant in the asymptomatic group whereas isolates of the 3D7 allele type were dominant in the uncomplicated malaria group.

Viral sequence data obtained from NGS experiments are a rich source of information, these data can be used to study their epidemiology, evolution, transmission patterns, and can also inform drug and vaccine design. Viral genomes, however, represent a great challenge to bioinformatics due to their high mutation rate and forming quasispecies in the same infected host, bringing about the need to implement advanced bioinformatics tools to assemble consensus genomes well-representative of the viral population circulating in individual patients. Many tools have been developed to preprocess sequencing reads, carry-out de novo or reference-assisted assembly of viral genomes and assess the quality of the genomes obtained. Most of these tools however exist as standalone workflows and usually require huge computational resources. Here we present (Viral Genomes Easily Analyzed), a Snakemake workflow for analyzing RNA viral genomes. VGEA enables users to map sequencing reads to the human genome to remove human contaminants, split bam files into forward and reverse reads, carry out de novo assembly of forward and reverse reads to generate contigs, pre-process reads for quality and contamination, map reads to a reference tailored to the sample using corrected contigs supplemented by the user's choice of reference sequences and evaluate/compare genome assemblies. We designed a project with the aim of creating a flexible, easy-to-use and all-in-one pipeline from existing/stand-alone bioinformatics tools for viral genome analysis that can be deployed on a personal computer. VGEA was built on the Snakemake workflow management system and utilizes existing tools for each step: fastp (Chen et al., 2018) for read trimming and read-level quality control, BWA (Li & Durbin, 2009) for mapping sequencing reads to the human reference genome, SAMtools (Li et al., 2009) for extracting unmapped reads and also for splitting bam files into fastq files, IVA (Hunt et al., 2015) for de novo assembly to generate contigs, shiver (Wymant et al., 2018) to pre-process reads for quality and contamination, then map to a reference tailored to the sample using corrected contigs supplemented with the user's choice of existing reference sequences, SeqKit (Shen et al., 2016) for cleaning shiver assembly for QUAST, QUAST (Gurevich et al., 2013) to evaluate/assess the quality of genome assemblies and MultiQC (Ewels et al., 2016) for aggregation of the results from fastp, BWA and QUAST. Our pipeline was successfully tested and validated with SARS-CoV-2 (n = 20), HIV-1 (n = 20) and Lassa Virus (n = 20) datasets all of which have been made publicly available.

Previous analysis of data from the International HapMap Project indicated that a CD36 haplotype bearing a nonsense mutation (T1264G; rs3211938) had undergone recent positive selection in the Yoruba of Nigeria. To investigate the global distribution of this putative selection event, we genotyped T1264G in 3420 individuals from 66 populations. We confirmed the high frequency of 1264G in the Yoruba (26%). However, the 1264G allele is less common in other African populations and absent from all non-African populations without recent African admixture. Using long-range linkage disequilibrium, we studied two West African groups in depth. Evidence for recent positive selection at the locus was demonstrable in the Yoruba, although not in Gambians. We screened 70 variants from across CD36 for an association with severe malaria phenotypes, employing a case-control study of 1350 subjects and a family study of 1288 parent-offspring trios. No marker was significantly associated with severe malaria. We focused on T1264G, genotyping 10,922 samples from four African populations. The nonsense allele was not associated with severe malaria (pooled allelic odds ratio 1.0; 95% confidence interval 0.89-1.12; P = 0.98).

SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: African American children with SSNS or steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) were enrolled from Duke University and centers participating in the Midwest Pediatric Nephrology Consortium. FACTOR: Genetic variants in HLA-DQA1 (C34Y [rs1129740]; F41S [rs1071630]) and APOL1 high-risk alleles. OUTCOMES: SSNS and SRNS. MEASUREMENTS: Direct sequencing for the HLA-DQA1 and APOL1 variants in 115 African American children (65 with SSNS and 50 with SRNS). Imputation of classic HLA alleles and amino acids was done in 363 South Asian children. RESULTS: The 2 HLA-DQA1 variants were significantly associated with SSNS in African American children (C34Y: P=5.7 × 10(-11); OR, 3.53; 95% CI, 2.33-5.42; F41S: P=1.2 × 10(-13); OR, 4.08; 95% CI, 2.70-6.28), but not with SRNS (C34Y: P=0.6; F41S: P=0.2).

HLA-DQA1*0201, HLA-DQB1*0201, and HLA-DRB1*0701 were the classic HLA alleles with the most significant associations with SSNS risk.

As of 29 April 2015, there have been 26,277 reported total cases (of which 14,895 have been laboratory confirmed) resulting in 10,899 deaths. The source of the outbreak was traced to the prefecture of Guéckédou in the forested region of southeastern Guinea. The virus later spread to the capital, Conakry, and to the neighbouring countries of Sierra Leone, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal and Mali. In March 2014, when the first cases were detected in Conakry, the Institut Pasteur of Dakar, Senegal, deployed a mobile laboratory in Donka hospital to provide diagnostic services to the greater Conakry urban area and other regions of Guinea. Through this process we sampled 85 Ebola viruses (EBOV) from patients infected from July to November 2014, and report their full genome sequences here. Phylogenetic analysis reveals the sustained transmission of three distinct viral lineages co-circulating in Guinea, including the urban setting of Conakry and its surroundings. One lineage is unique to Guinea and closely related to the earliest sampled viruses of the epidemic. A second lineage contains viruses probably reintroduced from neighbouring Sierra Leone on multiple occasions, while a third lineage later spread from Guinea to Mali. Each lineage is defined by multiple mutations, including non-synonymous changes in the virion protein 35 (VP35), glycoprotein (GP) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) proteins. The viral GP is characterized by a glycosylation site modification and mutations in the mucin-like domain that could modify the outer shape of the virion.

In this study, we used LM and broad-spectrum rRNA gene PCR-based assays on 116 blood samples from dogs brought to the UIVTH for detection of the 18S rRNA gene of Babesia and the 16S rRNA genes of Ehrlichia and hemotropic mycoplasmas. The relationship between clinicopathological findings and PCR results was evaluated. Age, sex, presence of ticks, anemia, co-infection status, and fever were also assessed in relation to PCR positivity to determine the risk factors using stepwise logistic regression analyses. Light microscopic examination revealed an overall prevalence of infection of 14.7% (17/116). Organisms detected were Babesia canis (3.5%), Ehrlichia canis (10.3%) and Trypanosoma congolense (0.9%) and a single co-infection with Babesia canis and Ehrlichia canis (0.9%).

A longitudinal study was carried out to investigate the transmission index of Simulium damnosum complex species along Osun River, South Western Nigeria. Adult flies were collected on human attractants from 07:00 to 18:00 hours for two consecutive days from February 2008 to June 2009 at three communities: Osun Eleja, Osun Ogbere and Osun Budepo. The infectivity rate was determined by dissection and Polymerase Chain Reaction amplification (PCR) of 0-150 genes of Onchocerca parasite using the pool screening technique. RESULTS: The results indicated that the majority of the flies collected at the three sampling points were nulliparous as they accounted for 53.90%, 57.86% and 59.58% of the flies dissected at Osun Budepo, Osun Ogbere and Osun Eleja, respectively. The parous rate was higher during the dry season than the wet season but the difference was not statistically significant (p < 0.05). The biting activity of the parous flies showed two peaks at Osun Budepo and three peaks at Osun Eleja and Osun Ogbere. Of the 1,472 flies dissected and 1,235 flies screened by molecular method, none was infected with Onchocerca parasite at the three sampling points however the annual biting rates at the three communities were higher than 1,000 considered as tolerable value for a person living in an onchocerciasis zone by Word Health Organization.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The pathology files of the Department of Oral Pathology and Oral Medicine, Faculty of Dentistry, Lagos State University College of Medicine, Lagos, Nigeria, were searched for the diagnosis of ameloblastoma from 2016 to 2020. Archived non-decalcified formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue underwent immunohistochemistry using anti-BRAF V600E antibody at the University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Clinicopathologic data such as age at diagnosis, gender, jaw bone involved (mandible or maxilla), tumor location (anterior or posterior) and histologic subtype were collected. The clinicopathologic parameters were analyzed using Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test according to the BRAF status. RESULTS: Forty-four cases of ameloblastoma were retrieved. The male to female ratio was 1.32:1. The average age of patients at diagnosis was 33.3 years. Thirty-nine cases were located in the mandible and 5 cases in the maxilla. Only cases in the mandible were positive for anti-BRAF V600E antibody (n = 15/39; 38.5%). There was a significant correlation between BRAF V600E expression in mandibular tumors and histologic subtype (p = 0.02); however, no significance was observed for gender, age and tumor location.

METHOD: Eighty-five adults with HCC and seventy-seven age and gender matched controls without evidence of liver disease or malignancy involving any part of the body, were recruited. Plasma DNA was analyzed for p53 codon 249 by restriction fragment length polymorphism. Patient evaluation was done by means questionnaire interview, clinical examination, laboratory and radiological tests. The prevalence of the p53 codon 249 mutation was expressed as a percentage amplifiable DNA samples analyzed from HCC patients while that of controls was expressed in the same way. Fisher's exact test or the student t-test where appropriate were used to assess statistical significance of prevalence between both groups as well as comparison of some characteristics in the HCC cases between those who had codon 249 mutation and those who did not. Associations between the various parameters assessed were determined by odds ratio and significant difference was specified at p < 0.05. RESULTS: p53 codon 249 mutation was present in 6 (7.6%) of the 79 samples from the HCC patients with amplifiable plasma DNA while none (i.e. 0%) of the 73 samples with amplifiable plasma DNA from the controls had this mutation. This prevalence is significantly higher among HCC patients than controls (0.029). The mutation was also found to be significantly associated with HCC (odds ratio = 2.00; 95% C I: 1.70 - 2.35).

Thus, NCD risk varies in obese individuals based on the location of their fat depots; while subcutaneous adiposity is protective, visceral adiposity increases NCD risk. Although, previously anthropometric traits have been used to quantify body shape in low-income settings, there is no consensus on how it should be assessed. Hence, there is a growing interest to evaluate body shape derived from the principal component analysis (PCA) of anthropometric traits; however, this is yet to be explored in individuals of African ancestry whose body shape is different from those of Europeans. We set out to capture body shape in its multidimensional structure and examine the association between genetic variants and body shape in individuals of African ancestry. METHOD AND RESULTS: We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for body shape derived from PCA analysis of anthropometric traits in the Ugandan General Population Cohort (GPC, n = 6407) and the South African Zulu Cohort (SZC, n = 2595), followed by a GWAS meta-analysis to assess the genetic variants associated with body shape. We identified variants in FGF12, GRM8, TLX1NB and TRAP1 to be associated with body shape. These genes were different from the genes been associated with BMI, height, weight, WC and waist-hip ration in continental Africans. Notably, we also observed that a standard deviation change in body shape was associated with an increase in blood pressure and blood lipids.

The emergence of drug resistance to first line drugs, artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), indicates an urgent need for continuous molecular surveillance of drug resistance especially in high burden countries where drug interventions are heavily relied on. This study describes mutations in Plasmodium falciparum genes associated with drug resistance in malaria; Pfk13, Pfmdr1, PfATPase6 and Pfcrt in isolates obtained from 83 symptomatic malaria patients collected in August 2014, aged 1-61 years old from South-west Nigeria. RESULTS: Two Pfmdr1, N86 and Y184 variants were present at a prevalence of 56% and 13.25% of isolates respectively. There was one synonymous (S679S) and two non-synonymous (M699V, S769M) mutations in the PATPase6 gene, while Pfcrt genotype (CVIET), had a prevalence of 45%. The Pfk13 C580Y mutant allele was suspected by allelic discrimination in two samples with mixed genotypes although this could not be validated with independent isolation or additional methods.

"266","Aaron_1","NO","Pediatric annals","Ten pearls (and pitfalls) in the management of the jaundiced newborn: Remember to take a history. Ask about jaundice in previous siblings and check family ethnicity. Don't ignore jaundice in the first 24 hours--it is considered pathologic until proven otherwise. Some normal infants may appear jaundiced and have a bilirubin level of 5 mg/dL at 23 hours and 59 minutes. On the other hand, a bilirubin level of 5 mg/dL at 10 hours is almost certainly pathologic. Use your judgment. Don't treat 35 to 37 week gestation infants as if they were full-term infants. Although these babies are cared for in well-baby nurseries and are generally treated like full-term infants, they are not full term. They are not as vigorous and do not nurse as well as full-term infants. Infants at 37 weeks gestation are four times more likely to have a serum bilirubin level greater than 13 mg/dL than those at 40 weeks gestation. Don't send 35-week gestation infants home before 48 hours. Document your assessment, particularly if the infant is being discharged early. Document the presence or absence of jaundice and its severity. A late rising bilirubin is typical of G6PD deficiency. Think about the ethnic background: G6PD deficiency is much more likely to occur in families from Greece, Turkey, Sardinia, and Nigeria, and particularly in Sephardic Jews from Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Kurdistan. Your practice may not contain many such families but remember in today's world of travel and intermarriage, etc, these genes are ubiquitous and the diagnosis of G6PD deficiency should always be considered in a newborn child with a significant elevation of bilirubin, particularly if it is a male and the rise in bilirubin is of late onset. Don't use homeopathic doses of phototherapy. As with any drug, phototherapy should be provided in a therapeutic dose (see above), but with the light sources commonly used, it is impossible to overdose the patient. Don't ignore a failure of response to phototherapy. If the bilirubin rises despite adequate phototherapy, there must be a reason. Consider the possibility of an unrecognized hemolytic process. Provide timely follow-up. Infants discharged (as most are) before 48 hours should be seen by a health-care professional within 2 to 3 days of discharge. Don't ignore prolonged jaundice. About one in three normal breast-fed infants still will be clinically jaundiced when they are 2 weeks old (two thirds will be biochemically jaundiced). These infants all have indirect hyperbilirubinemia. Occasionally, however, an infant with prolonged jaundice has direct hyperbilirubinemia. In these infants, the diagnosis of biliary atresia or some other cause of cholestatic jaundice must be considered. If the infant is clinically jaundiced beyond age 2 weeks, you should: 1) check the newborn record to make sure that the metabolic screen for hypothyroidism is normal (congenital hypothyroidism is a cause of indirect hyperbilirubinemia), and 2) ask the mother about the color of the urine and stool. If the baby's stools are pale or the urine is dark yellow, you must get a direct bilirubin to rule out cholestasis. If there is direct hyperbilirubinemia, a urine dipstick will identify the presence of bile (bilirubin). If the color of the urine and stool are normal (by history), it is reasonable to follow the child for another week. However, any infant who is still jaundiced beyond age 3 weeks must have a measurement of direct bilirubin. Don't ignore severe jaundice. If the bilirubin is sufficiently elevated, kernicterus can occur in a healthy, breast-fed infant.","Clinical rounds in the well-baby nursery: treating jaundiced newborns.","24","547-52","Maisels MJ"
"267","Aaron_1","NO","PLoS medicine","BACKGROUND: Despite significant global progress in reducing neonatal mortality, bacterial sepsis remains a major cause of neonatal deaths. Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) is the leading pathogen globally underlying cases of neonatal sepsis and is frequently resistant to antibiotic treatment regimens recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), including first-line therapy with ampicillin and gentamicin, second-line therapy with amikacin and ceftazidime, and meropenem. Maternal vaccination to prevent neonatal infection could reduce the burden of K. pneumoniae neonatal sepsis in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), but the potential impact of vaccination remains poorly quantified. We estimated the potential impact of such vaccination on cases and deaths of K. pneumoniae neonatal sepsis and project the global effects of routine immunization of pregnant women with the K. pneumoniae vaccine as antimicrobial resistance (AMR) increases. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed a Bayesian mixture-modeling framework to estimate the effects of a hypothetical K. pneumoniae maternal vaccine with 70% efficacy administered with coverage equivalent to that of the maternal tetanus vaccine on neonatal sepsis infections and mortality. To parameterize our model, we used data from 3 global studies of neonatal sepsis and/or mortality-with 2,330 neonates who died with sepsis surveilled from 2016 to 2020 undertaken in 18 mainly LMICs across all WHO regions (Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Uganda, Brazil, Italy, Greece, Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, Thailand, China, and Vietnam). Within these studies, 26.95% of fatal neonatal sepsis cases were culture-positive for K. pneumoniae. We analyzed 9,070 K. pneumoniae genomes from human isolates gathered globally from 2001 to 2020 to quantify the temporal rate of acquisition of AMR genes in K. pneumoniae isolates to predict the future number of drug-resistant cases and deaths that could be averted by vaccination. Resistance rates to carbapenems are increasing most rapidly and 22.43% [95th percentile Bayesian credible interval (CrI): 5.24 to 41.42] of neonatal sepsis deaths are caused by meropenem-resistant K. pneumoniae. Globally, we estimate that maternal vaccination could avert 80,258 [CrI: 18,084 to 189,040] neonatal deaths and 399,015 [CrI: 334,523 to 485,442] neonatal sepsis cases yearly worldwide, accounting for more than 3.40% [CrI: 0.75 to 8.01] of all neonatal deaths. The largest relative benefits are in Africa (Sierra Leone, Mali, Niger) and South-East Asia (Bangladesh) where vaccination could avert over 6% of all neonatal deaths. Nevertheless, our modeling only considers country-level trends in K. pneumoniae neonatal sepsis deaths and is unable to consider within-country variability in bacterial prevalence that may impact the projected burden of sepsis.

Using MTBDRplus as a comparator, we evaluated the predictive value of Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert)-detected RIF resistance for MDR-TB in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study involving data from new or retreatment pulmonary adult TB cases evaluated between July 2013 and December 2016. Separate, paired sputa for smear microscopy and MTBDRplus were collected. Xpert testing was performed subject to the availability of Xpert cartridges on sample remnants after microscopy. RESULTS: Among 353 patients, 193 (54.7%) were previously treated and 224 (63.5%) were MTBDRplus TB positive. Of the 224, 43 (19.2%) were RIF monoresistant, 11 (4.9%) were INH monoresistant, 53 (23.7%) had MDR-TB, and 117 (52.2%) were RIF and INH susceptible. Overall, among the 96 samples detected by MTBDRplus as RIF resistant, 53 (55.2%) had MDR-TB. Xpert testing was performed in 179 (50.7%) specimens; among these, 163 (91.1%) were TB positive and 73 (44.8%) RIF resistant. Only 45/73 (61.6%) Xpert-identified RIF-resistant isolates had concomitant MTBDRplus-detected INH resistance. Xpert had a sensitivity of 100.0% (95% CI, 92.1-100.0) for detecting RIF resistance but a positive-predictive value of only 61.6% (95% CI, 49.5-72.8) for MDR-TB. The most frequent mutations associated with RIF and INH resistance were S531L and S315T1, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In this high-risk MDR-TB study population, Xpert had low positive-predictive value for the presence of MDR-TB.

Though at least 40 loci have attained genomewide significant association with nonsyndromic CL/P, these loci largely reside in noncoding regions of the human genome, and subsequent resequencing studies of neighboring candidate genes have revealed only a limited number of etiologic coding variants. The present study was conducted to identify etiologic coding variants in GREM1, a locus that has been shown to be largely associated with cleft of both lip and soft palate. PATIENTS AND METHOD: We resequenced DNA from 397 sub-Saharan Africans with CL/P and 192 controls using Sanger sequencing. Following analyses of the sequence data, we observed 2 novel coding variants in GREM1. These variants were not found in the 192 African controls and have never been previously reported in any public genetic variant database that includes more than 5000 combined African and African American controls or from the CL/P literature. RESULTS: The novel variants include p.Pro164Ser in an individual with soft palate cleft only and p.Gly61Asp in an individual with bilateral cleft lip and palate. The proband with the p.Gly61Asp GREM1 variant is a van der Woude (VWS) case who also has an etiologic variant in IRF6 gene.

"272","Aaron_1","NO","Annals of tropical medicine and parasitology","As the genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum infections in humans is implicated in the pathogenesis of malaria, the association between P. falciparum diversity at the merozoite surface protein-2 (msp2) locus and the severity of childhood malaria was investigated in Ibadan, in south-western Nigeria. The 400 children enrolled had acute uncomplicated malaria (144), cerebral malaria (64), severe malarial anaemia (67) or asymptomatic infections with P. falciparum (125). Nested PCR was used to investigate the msp2 genotype(s) of the parasites infecting each child. In terms of the complexity of infection and frequency of polyinfection, the children with asymptomatic infection were significantly different from those with uncomplicated malaria or severe malaria. The median number of FC27 alleles detected was higher in the asymptomatic children than in the symptomatic. After controlling for age and level of parasitaemia (with 'asymptomatic infection' as the reference category), a child in whom no FC27 alleles were detected was found to be at five-fold greater risk of uncomplicated malaria, and a child without polyinfection was found to have a three-fold increased risk of severe malarial anaemia and a six-fold increased risk of cerebral malaria. It therefore appears that msp2 genotypes are associated with asymptomatic carriage and that children with mono-infections are more likely to develop severe malaria than children with polyinfection.","Complexity of the msp2 locus and the severity of childhood malaria, in south-western Nigeria.","102","95-102","Amodu OK and Oyedeji SI and Ntoumi F and Orimadegun AE and Gbadegesin RA and Olumese PE and Omotade OO"
